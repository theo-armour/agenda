# First Look

Hello Jennifer, Patrick, Tom & Val

Kindly have a look at this link. 

Heritage Happenings Website
https://heritage-happenings.github.io/#Blog/2025-06-09-Heritage-Happenings-Website-Soft-Opening.md

The link takes you to a beta-test version of the website I intend to use as the basis for transforming the _Heritage Happenings_ from a paper-first publication to a web-first medium.

The post should help you understand the kind of feedback that is important at this stage.
