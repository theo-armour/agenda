# Messages to Staff

I am the editor of a monthly newsletter for elderly residents of an upmarket retirement community for elders in San Francisco. The readership also includes friends, family, staff and the board of directors.

Please prepare two or three sentences written by each of the people in following admin positions:

* CEO
* Chief Financial Officer ~ new Yardi accounting and Rent Cafe software
* Director of Nursing Services ~ medical records and new staff training
* Director of marketing ~ new website and social media campaign
* Director of sales ~ new residents and the centenary celebrations
* Director of dining services ~ country of the month, birthday and holiday celebrations
* Director of Environmental Services ~ preparing for the centenary celebrations and  rehabilitating the Morgan Elevator
* Director of Human Resources ~ new employee orientation and training
* Director of activities ~


Each statement describes what the staff member is looking forward to in 2025 as it relates to their job and the wellness of the residents. The statements should be written in a friendly, conversational tone.
