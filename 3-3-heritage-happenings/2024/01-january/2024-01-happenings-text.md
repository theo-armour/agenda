Rooms Chapter 5 - Back To New York, On To San Francisco
You may remember that the last installment of this memoir left off, after our sojourn in New Orleans, with my baby son and I waiting in Atlanta for my husband Duncan to find us a home in New York, where he was attending medical school.
Baltic Street, Brooklyn
Ah, Brooklyn! In 1947, Duncan, now out of the Army (but still in the Army Reserve – more on that later!), started his second year of medical school at the Long Island School of Medicine (now part of the Down State Medical Center) in Brooklyn and spent his spare time looking for an apartment we could afford. Housing had not improved much since the end of the war and was still hard to find. At last, with the help of the woman in the rental office of the Tower and Homes complex (Jane Holran, who became a good friend of the family), he was able to rent a tiny one-bedroom apartment in the complex at 132 Baltic Street, just below Brooklyn Heights. The other big buildings of the Towers required coal stoves for cooking, heating and hot water, but ours had a real bathroom, steam heat, running hot water, and a gas stove. The buildings were six story walk-ups but, fortunately, our apartment was on the second floor. The apartment was so small we had to hang our washing outside, and our bed barely fit in the tiny bedroom!
The Tower and Homes complex was built just after the Civil War to house industrial workers. It was a new-model tenement – an experiment in providing durable (brick and stone) worker housing, designed to let in more light and air than was then normal for low-income housing. The experiment was clearly a success because the complex still exists, now as a trendy piece of Brooklyn living called “Cobble Hill Towers,” with a historic designation.
ELIZABETH ARRIVES
Our second child, Elizabeth, was born while we lived on Baltic Street, making an already too small apartment smaller. She spent the first six months sleeping in a basket on the dining table. After that, I arranged for crib-sized bunks to be built for the two kids and crammed into the tiny bedroom along with our double bed.

We Move To San Francisco
In 1949 Duncan graduated from medical school. During that summer he, with our friends Jean and Bob Payne, went out by train to San Francisco to look for internships. Duncan got his at San Francisco General, Bob in Oakland. I spent the summer in Atlanta with Tom and Elizabeth. When the three were ready to take the train back East, Jean suggested I meet them in New Orleans. So, I left the children in Atlanta with their grandparents and got on a westbound train. I got into New Orleans the night before the train from San Francisco with Duncan and the Paynes was due in.
It was August, I was 7 months pregnant with my third child, Anne, and the town was full of Shriners. No hotel rooms. I did finally find one and in the morning started looking for the travelers in every hotel in town. I finally found them at breakfast. New Orleans was hot and steamy and not air-conditioned except for a drug store that was so cold it felt like a hot wet blanket had fallen on you when you came out. The train back to Atlanta had open windows spewing soot all over us (the aqe of steam!). We spent the rest of the summer in Atlanta until Duncan went back to San Francisco to start work.
Once Duncan had found an apartment in San Francisco, we -- Tom, baby Elizabeth, and I -- flew out to join him. That was the most difficult flight I have ever taken. There was no food service, I ran out of bottles and diapers for the baby, the airplane stopped everywhere – Pittsburgh, Chicago, Kansas City, Phoenix, Los Angeles. At each stop I tried to find out which airport around San Francisco we would land at and at each stop I got a different destination. When we got to LA we had to change planes. By that time, I couldn’t tell Duncan where we would come in. It turned out to be Oakland and, miracle of miracles, he and a friend with a car turned up there!
Next chapter: Mission Street, San Francisco!

## The 5 Biggest Changes to Social Security in 2024

1. Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) Benefit Boost
Inflation cooled considerably in 2023, but consumer prices still went up, producing a 3.2 percent COLA for Social Security beneficiaries.
2. Medicare Premium
The standard monthly Part B rate will rise from $164.90 to $174.70, shaving about $10 a month off the COLA gain.
3. Social Security Taxes
If you are working, in 2024, the threshold of deductions will go up to $168,600.
4. Social Security Earnings
If you collect Social Security and continue to work in 2024, beneficiaries who will not reach FRA until a later year have $1 withheld from their Social Security payment for every $2 in work income above $22,320 (up from $21,240 in 2023).
5. Qualifying for Benefits
You become eligible for retirement benefits by collecting Social Security credits, which you  get by doing “covered” work — a job or self-employment in which you pay Social Security taxes on your income.  It takes 10 years of covered work, to qualify for retirement benefits (the 10 years do not need to be consecutive). To qualify for SSDI(social security disability insurance),  the qualifications required can range from 1 ½ years of work or more, depending on how old you are when a medical condition sidelines you from work.
How do I Talk to a Real Person at Social Security?
You can call our national number at 1-800-772-1213 between 8:00 am – 7:00 pm., Monday through Friday. Wait times to speak to a representative are typically shorter early in the day (between 8 am and 10 am local time) or later in the afternoon (between 4 pm and 7 pm local time).

## Aging in place

In our November issue I talked about the idea that even if my health begins to fail in a significant way that I can transfer to Assisted Living quarters and still be in touch wih all my familiar friends, participate in all the activities I know and to enjoy the same food and dining service that I have become accustomed to.

But what happens if my health begins to fail somewhat moderately. What If I need help doing laundry or making my bed. What If I need help washing myself in the shower without worrying about falling?

If this does happen, will I have to move? Maybe not. I am on an Independent Living Center (ILC) Type C - Continuing care contract. Every year we get a fees for service update. This lists the charges for a number of services that can be supplied by the Nursing and Housekeeping staff at Heritage on the Marina

The fees for these services are actually reasonable for a one-off use, but something like bed-making is usually a daily requirement. So, if I need help with this, I would have to pay for it every day. Depending of the services needed, this could become expensive.

Every case is different. The least costly solution might be simply to move to an Assisted Living apartment. The charges are very reasonably. There are four levels of service that depend on the amount of time team members spend wth a resident every day. We have resident that require a really a lot of help and yet even the maximum charge is much less than skilled nursing facility charges that I have seen or heard about.

If I understand things correctly, it is quite possible for ILC residents to negotiate monthly service charges that are in many instances as reasonable as the Assisted Living charges.

In other words, with a bit of planning and consultation, even if I've got some health issues, I may be able stay in my apartment and continue to enjoy the life I have become accustomed to at a price I can afford this side of paradise.
