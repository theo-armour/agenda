## Patrick: Notes to Theo for inclusion in the Heritage Happenings

I would like to thank all the people who called and emailed me when I had covid. It was very encouraging since you are confined to your apartment and do not have contact with anyone.

I have no idea how I contacted covid. I had visited Safeway some days before and also the post office, the library and Walgreens. So at any one of those places could have been a time that someone coughed behind me and passed on the disease.

While I was confined to my apartment some friends passed on some philosophical comments that I found amusing. I list them below.

~ Jean Kerr...
The only reason they say 'Women and children first' is to test the strength of the lifeboats.

~ Prince Philip...
When a man opens a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife.

 ~ Jean Rostand...
Kill one man and you're a murderer, kill a million and you're a conqueror.

~ Arnold Schwarzenegger...
Having more money doesn't make you happier. I have 50 million dollars but I'm just as happy as when I had 48 million.

~ WH Auden..
We are here on earth to do good unto others. What the others are here for, I have no idea.

~ Old Italian proverb...
After the game, the King and the pawn go into the same box.

~ Anonymous
There are only 3 things certain in life

* Death
* Taxes
* And Mattresses are always on sale.

Regards

Patrick

Updates from the library committee:
Looking for a specific book: The binder on the table is up-to-date. You can easily search for any book in the library by title or author. The library also has a computer, which is a bit slow, with the information. The computer is not for personal use.
Returning a book: Please do not put back on a shelf but rather in the return books box. It is up to committee members to return a book to its proper place.
Donating a book: Again, there is a box for donating books. As we have limited space on our shelves, please don‚Äôt donate paperbacks.
Want to get rid of a catalogue or magazine: Please don‚Äôt put it on our table. We try not to have clutter.
Need help: Please contact one of our library committee members: Martha Nell Beatty, Yvonne Benedict, Pam Fischer, Gene Graham and Kay Narron


## Rooms Chapter 11 ‚Äì Away From The Coasts, On To The Heartland
You may remember from the last installment that my family and I spent most of the 60s in New York City, mostly on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. But in 1970, Duncan, to make us financially secure later in life, took a high-paying position as a consulting pathologist in southeastern Iowa. A former colleague of Duncan‚Äôs from San Francisco had established a profitable business servicing small hospitals in Iowa and Illinois. Within a few years he needed help and invited Duncan into the business.
Off To The Midwest
We went out in the bitterly cold January of 1970 to check out the situation. It was so cold in Chicago that the hotel had to evacuate one entire side that they were unable to keep warm, and our flight was delayed for some time because of pipes freezing up. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a try.
The position was based in Fort Madison, on the Mississippi River (the townsfolk were sure that it was the model for River City in the musical ‚ÄúThe Music Man‚Äù). We lived there for almost 6 years, first in two rentals then in the house we had built for us.
We found it almost impossible to rent anything suitable in Ft. Madison: our choices seemed to be tract houses at the edge of town where every picture window looked across the street into the neighbor's picture window, or apartments smelling of cold bacon fat.
Life In Small Town Iowa
We were very unsure of what we would find in Iowa -- we even arranged for mail-order limes for our Sunday daiquiris, assuming such an exotic fruit would be unavailable (as it happened, the local Hispanic population of farm workers ensured that limes were not a problem). There were some culture shocks, though ‚Äì the frozen vegetable case at the supermarket consisted pretty much of ten feet of various frozen potatoes and a few bags of frozen peas at the end and the speed limit on the town‚Äôs main street was 15 mph (although few people drove THAT fast). But the meat ‚Äì lamb and pork especially -- was amazingly good. Chicago was reasonably convenient by train or small airplane, and we went there several times a year.
But the climate! In winter, nothing between us and the North Pole but some barbed wire fences -- I actually got knocked down by the wind in Chicago one winter! And in summer, stifling heat and humidity and the most insects I had seen since New Orleans.
Fort Madison was interesting. The river is a mile wide at that point ‚Äì an impressive presence. Right across the river is Nauvoo, Illinois, the center of the Mormon religion in the early 1800s and the starting point of the great trek to Utah. Hannibal, Missouri, of Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn fame, is about two hours down river. Geode State Park and Old Threshers‚Äô Museum (steam-powered agricultural equipment, really fascinating) are nearby. The Schaefer Pen company was founded and headquartered in Fort Madison, so there were many corporate executives living near us.
The town had a lot of history, having been settled even before President Jefferson sent an expedition through the area to explore the country‚Äôs new western holdings. The early settlers had built one- or two-room houses to give quick shelter from the fierce weather, and many of them were still there in 1970, some joined together, some extended. They were followed by larger houses as the years passed. I found the progression fascinating and made a study of them that I showed to the women‚Äôs group I had joined. They loved the photos, but the library turned my offered study down. The 19th Century structures included a wild gothic fantasy of a library with a history reminiscent of ‚ÄúThe Music Man‚Äù (‚ÄùHe left River City the library building but he left all the books to HER!‚Äù).
Our House
It was soon clear we would have to build a house if we were to live comfortably, so we bought about eight acres on Blackhawk Heights above the Mississippi River ‚Äî mostly ravine and woods, but including about three acres on gently sloping ground ‚Äì and found an ambitious young builder who made blueprints of the plans I drew up, and off we went!
Building went on during the winter of 1970-1971. At one point a pile of lumber destined for the living room ceiling was walked on by visitors or workers ‚Äì imagine our dismay to see footprints on our ceiling! But the contractor got up there and fixed it. The day of the house warming the frozen driveway thawed, leaving gravely mud that I worried cars would get stuck in. But Midwest weather is unpredictable: a nor‚Äôwester swept in, re-freezing the ground, and no one had to be pulled out of mud.
The house was the highlight of our Midwest life. The living room had a 15-foot-high cathedral ceiling and clerestory windows and was dominated by a massive fireplace/chimney of white Georgia marble. It was a wonderful space -- I always felt very peaceful in that room. Floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides of the dining area looked out over our property and a wrap-around balcony. The kitchen was designed to my specifications and was a pleasure to cook in. The lower level, giving out onto the back yard, had a sauna and a large workroom that I used for sewing and my fabric sales business. The bidet in our bathroom was a seven-day wonder in small-town Iowa ‚Äì our builder invited contractors from all over the area in to see it during construction!
We were very happy with that house, Duncan was happy making good money, and I was happy with the activities I got involved in. I played tennis with Father Smith, who lived in the Catholic hospital, taken care of by the German sisters nursing staff. He had an apartment and a motorboat. He loved coming to our house for dinner with martinis and he showed Duncan and me how to water ski. He did his work well, but finally applied to the bishop to release him from the clergy.
Moving On Again
Eventually, the consulting arrangement fell apart, and in 1975 Duncan found a position with the Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and we went back to where I started in 1942!
