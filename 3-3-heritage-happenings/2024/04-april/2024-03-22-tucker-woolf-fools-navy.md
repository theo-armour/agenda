In the upper class London Bloomsbury district there arose a privileged and sheltered group of intellectual authors, gathered around Virginia Stephen Wolfe who ran an elite publishing company for the likes of TS Eliot and James Joyce.

Virginia's cousin was the British naval admiral, giving her presumably, some access to clerical operations.
