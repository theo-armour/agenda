# Wellness Agenda

## Agenda

* Set up the Hettler dimensions

## My Dimensions of Wellness

* List current docs here
* Add to do for diet
* Add to do for exercise
* Add to do for mind?


## Fecal incontinence

* Diapers 24x7
* Need easy access to toilet with spare diapers
* Mostly from 10 am to 5pm
* Need to feel free to leave the venue
* I did the San Juan Bautista trip without peeing and pooing - not healthy

## Movement

* A few weeks ago, my back was hurting
* I went back walking every 18 minutes
* Things much improved as a result

## Fitness Levels

* My walking compares only slightly favorably with the fit 90 year olds
* Aging is taking a big toll on my disabled muscles

## My people

* I go to the dining room three times a day
* What I do there is, in essence, a performance
* I ask about baseball scores or the ballet performance
* I get involved, I know their histories, I understand their capabilities and lack thereof
* Perhaps 50 people
* I turn a table of four people sitting without saying a word to a table with laughter
* They all love it as long as I am not sitting with them to frequently
* this happens because most of them are old enough to be my parents
* They feel I have the energy they used to have.
