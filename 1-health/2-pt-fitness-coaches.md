Vision

* Fitness in 2027 is ¨as targeted¨
* Not trying to break records just trying to maintain fitness

Not to do

* Exercise for an hour and think my exercising for the day is over
* Spend significant amount of time preparing for and recovering from exercising - in terms of clothes, travel, mental state

Specifications / Schema

* Exercise is a series of numerous events that occur throughout the day
* Exercise can occur anywhere ~ no need for special equipment or venue
* Exercise can start any time ~ no time needed is to prepare
* Sessions are monitored and data saved to the cloud with no human intervention
* Targets are set for all event types
* Walking may include events such as walking without a cane, standing very straight, stooping steps and more
* Non-walking events are structured so that all major muscle groups are affected

Current

* 5,000 steps per day
* 80 minutes movement
* 10 minutes heart points in Google Fit
* ~15 movement bars per day in Google Fit
* 1:20 plank or 100 elbow push-ups ++ before bed
* 12 leg lifts + 24 bicycles ++ before rising
* 12 squats + touch toes while showering

Current issues

* Not doing the arm weights
* Not doing the desk bike

Target

* 7,000 steps per day
* 24 movement bars per day in Google Fit

Wanted

* Understanding, strategies and exercises that help mitigate against stooping or hunching over
* Strategies that assist with upper body and aerobic work
