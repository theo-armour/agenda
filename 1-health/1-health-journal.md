Thank you for your feedback. It is always appreciated when patients provide helpful and honest feedback that we can use to make effective changes to better serve you all! I will forward this to our team of engineers. Thanks again!

Thank you for your reply

Let's see what happens. The team of engineers are a large part of why the PPF online communications portal has issues.

May I also request that you also send my feedback to PPH to marketing and operations?
