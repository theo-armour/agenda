Thank you for your considered reply.

>> seeing me again for another visit, to really focus on the numbness

I will be pleased to see you again.

>> I didn't see a mention of a shoulder referral

Correct. It was my my primary care provider who made the suggestion that I contact you regarding a shoulder referral.

The onset of the numbness in my hand is just about every morning between 5 and 7 am. Because of it, I usually wake up more than once. Generally, I move my entire arm to another position and wait for the numbness in my hand to diminish. If it does not diminish, I move my arm to another position. After I actually get up, the numbness disappears and does not reoccur during the day unless I'm doing a long walk with a cane or walker.

Cheers,

Theo


## message to Theo

Theo, I looked back at my note and I didn't see a mention of a shoulder referral, at least not regarding the hand numbness. On our assesment it didn't seem like the hand numbness was related to any of the common things like carpal tunnel or cubital tunnel syndrome, but we also had quite a bit of other things to discuss like your wrist arthritis so perhaps didn't give the numbness the attention it deserved.

So what I would suggest is if you don't mind seeing me again for another visit, to really focus on the numbness, so I can send you to the right folks (or perhaps diagnose the problem)
