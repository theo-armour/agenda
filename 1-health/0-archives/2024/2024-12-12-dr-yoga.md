Hi Doctor Yoga

I will be seeing you later today.

Insurance codes
I would like to explore the idea of obtaining dental insurance. Perhaps with delta dental. It would be helpful in order to determine the value if I could d have the medical insurance codes that you typically have used or applied to the consultations you have provided me in the past.


Can you help me with this or pass me on to somebody who can? Also perhaps an idea as to which insurance seems to work best with ucsf.

Issue with one of the upper left molars
Seemed to have a crack or loose feeling. Pain in the tooth occurs when I bite hard on something like a nut or pit.

Stain

Over a month ago a deep black stain appeared on my tongue and teeth and also around my anus. I believe it came from a cup of coffee brewed in a Keurig machine where's the capsule had had manufacturing issue. I attach a photo of my tongue showing 2 black stripes that remain.

You can see the stains have been very slow to disappear. And all of this has just added more discoloration to my teeth. I have been using opalescence go, but it has not had much effect. I look forward to your good advice as what could be done improve the situation.

See you soon,

Theo
