Frequent inflammations
I seem to experience inflammations of the lower, right rear extraction site once a month or so. Is there anything I can do to prevent these from occurring?


## Toothpaste & Mouth Care

Any recommendations?

## Dental checkups for assisted-living residents
I live in a residential care facility for the elderly. A number of our residents are in assisted living. The nursing director here Would like to establish a service where assisted living residents can have Dental checkups In our facility.

Do you know of any practitioner or service that offers us such A service?
