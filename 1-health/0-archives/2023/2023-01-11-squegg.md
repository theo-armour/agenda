# Heart my Squegg - yet...

Hi Squegg team
I heart my Squegg. Please make more (and better) products that count hand and arm movement - and I will buy!
I have the new upgraded app - version 4.5 - running on the latest Samsung Galaxy 22 Ultra. And there are issues!Android reports the app is crashing frequentlyI have to pair every time I open the appThe grip count numbers are way too small to read from any distance (compare with earlier version or with readouts from step count apps)
