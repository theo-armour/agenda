The more I don't see you the better, right? Life trundles on. Except for what I will describe in a bit, health feels quite good. The Google Fit app tells me I am walking over 45 minutes a day. Alcohol consumption is declining. Weight is stable/declining slightly. Diet is nicely Mediterraneanized. Still no Glaucoma drops needed. Inguinal hernia repair seems to be history. Ditto bursitis. Right hip and colon seem fine.

The only significant current issues are the ongoing tingling feet (and sometimes lower body), occasional light-headed feeling, a weird "eyes heel heavy" symptom. These occur mostly in the morning before I have eaten much and while sitting at the computer. None of these seem to impede my daily routines in any significant manner - apart from the minor worry they cause.

The symptoms do not cause me to be breathless, or disturb my ability to read small text on screen or stop me from coding or type all day. They may be more apparent the day after drinking four or five portions of alcohol.

The other interesting symptom is soft loose stool with 2mm to 5mm air pockets ( think of the holes in a sponge or miniature Swiss cheese). It leaves a whitish scum or slick and has a slightly rancid smell and is occasionally expressed explosively.

The less interesting symptoms are psoriasis and rashes in varying locations - which I medicate by slathering on Aquaphore cream.

The single medication I take is 20 mg of Omeprazole a day - which I take to prevent dysphagia. I stopped taking probiotics, prebiotics, aspirin and vitamins some time last year.

This all pretty much as I mentioned in a message to you last December. At that time, any investigation was postponed until after the hernia repair. Well, that time seems to have arrived. Your thoughts and suggestions as to what I can do will be appreciated.

Dr Martin

Recovery from my surgery is going well.

Would you kindly arrange a referral for physical therapy with a medical diagnosis indicating medical necessity?

The left hip replacement in 2015, colectomy in 2017 and recent inguinal hernia repair on top of my ongoing partial paraplegia and left hand amputation hand have left me me in a significantly weakened state and at greater risk of falling. For example, I now require the use of my hand in order to stand up from a chair and this was not an issue several years ago.

It would be great if a physical therapist could look at how I work and live so as to help me develop a regimen that overcomes these issues.

I have been in touch with this practice:

I am a happy owner of a Dolomite Alpha Advanced acquired several years ago via mail order.

I have walked many miles with it and so the wheels are beginning to have issues.

Do you know of anybody person or organization in the San Francisco Bay area that could service the wheels?

Another possibility would be to order new wheels from you.

In any case, it would be great to hear about yours suggestions for maintaining my "walking buddy".

Under the Products drop-down menu on this site you will see the Dolomite brand.  Under the Find a Rep drop-down menu you will see four sales representatives who represent Northern California (http://clarkehealthcare.com/find-a-rep/california-north/).  Of these four, the VA people deal with either Debra Gruttadauro or Jeff Hopson.

Hi Martha

It took me until just a few days ago to discover that you are now on the list of UCSF peeps I am allowed to message via MyChart. I welcome you to a panoply of heroes. I look for to an occasional, ongoing, online dialog.

In your message of February you sent two links:

* http://www.seniorsonly.club/
* https://www.silversurfers.com/

I have been to both sites several times. At first I kind of poo-poo-ed them. But upon reflection, the level of discourse is reasonably high, people are very welcoming, and there are no trolls and no trash-talk. In this era of flame wars, being able to maintain a friendly community is certainly a really nice thing. So thank you for the introductions. I do plan to revisit them and participate in some ways. Thank you for this research.

Theo
