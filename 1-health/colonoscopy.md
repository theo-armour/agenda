## Boston Bowel Prep Scale

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763922/

> Each region of the colon receives a “segment score” from 0 to 3 and these segment scores are summed for a total BBPS score ranging from 0 to 9. Therefore, the maximum BBPS score for a perfectly clean colon without any residual liquid is 9 and the minimum BBPS score for an unprepared colon is 0

## 2023 Lessons Learned

* Simethicone (Gas-X) is your friend
* Wear non-slip socks
* Warm the room

No poo on the walls, or carpet this time. Much more under control.

Possible reasons

* Much more well-rounded diet
* From Bran Buds every day to granola twice a week
* Half-dose Miralax every day ~ slipper stool
* Butt tightening exercises every day + less reduced pushing ~ more control over anus
* Three Simethicones before each prep session ~ less gas
* Swimming diapers prevent poo from getting out of control ~ fewer spills
* Equal prep and water + ginger ales


## 2020 ~ Lessons Learned

* "Explosive diarrhea - can hit a wall ten feet away ~ curiously no significant farting"
* Stop most high fiber items five days before
* No food for ~40 hours before
* White wine is a clear liquid
* Ditto ginger ale
* No need to take shower before prep ~ you will be taking many showers later
* Drink equal amounts of Prep|Gavilyte|GoLightly and water
* One glass of prep + one glass of water

Prepare the bathroom

* Ensure no/zero/none trips out of the bathroom are needed
* Stool place for phone and computer ( not used in 2020 )
* Cleaning poo off carpet is not fun. Ditto off walls
* Move wastebaskets and any other possible targets around toilet out of the way
* Bring a full bag of diapers

When poo is squirting
* Sit on toilet before taking off diaper
* In shower cover butt with hand

Looking for:

* Clear yellow liquid yellow, light, liquid, and clear, like urine
* No lumps but may be millimeter size particles and the add corn kernel

Fall Risk

* The yellow liquid coats floor, hand, whatever with the most slippery substance known to mankind
* Big increase to fall risk
* Consider a non slip mat

Also

* Keep wiping rag in shower
* It gets cold being naked in there! So take hot showers every ten minutes. Wear tee shirt??
* Allow for urinating and final diaper change before leaving


### Post Colonoscopy

* Be very careful
* Poo happens
* Sit on toilet and test every every hour until nothing appears

## 2020-10-21
