## Endoscope & Video Processor

### Single-Use Scope for Colonoscopies

* https://www.aclsonline.us/blog/fda-clears-worlds-first-single-use-scope-for-colonoscopies/
* The FDA granted approval this month for Invendo Medical to sell the world’s first single-use colonoscope. The new $200 sterile scope is expected to solve the problems associated with reprocessing scopes for colonoscopies.


### Pentax J10

8 https://sites.pentaxmedical.com/eb-j10-series/p/1

both available on Ebay for under $7K. More reasonable than I expected.
Got the Pentax J10 yet?

* Add ultrasound

Videos of the procedure on the way??

* Not now because of size
  * Bogus issue: Average HD movie is 4GB. 16TB drives are $350 hold data for 4,000 procedures
* Will start to create a corpus of data which in turn will open way for AI


## Boston Bowel Prep Scale

* https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763922/

> Each region of the colon receives a “segment score” from 0 to 3 and these segment scores are summed for a total BBPS score ranging from 0 to 9. Therefore, the maximum BBPS score for a perfectly clean colon without any residual liquid is 9 and the minimum BBPS score for an unprepared colon is 0

## 2023 Lessons Learned

* Simeticone (Gas-X) is your friend
* Wear non-slip socks
* Warm the room

## 2023 ~ Lessons Learned

No poo on the walls, or carpet this time. Much more under control.

Possible reasons

* Much more well-rounded diet
* From Bran Buds every day to granola twice a week
* Half-dose Miralax every day ~ slipper stool
* Butt tightening exercises every day + less reduced pushing ~ more control over anus
* Three Simeticones before each prep session ~ less gas
* Swimming diapers prevent poo from getting out of control ~ fewer spills
* Equal prep and water + ginger ales


## 2020 ~ Lessons Learned

* "Explosive diarrhea - can hit a wall ten feet away ~ curiously no significant farting"
* Stop most high fiber items five days before
* No food for ~40 hours before
* White wine is a clear liquid
* Ditto ginger ale
* No need to take shower before prep ~ you will be taking many showers later
* Drink equal amounts of Prep|Gavilyte|GoLightly and water
  * One glass of prep + one glass of water
* Prepare the bathroom
  * Ensure no/zero/none trips out of the bathroom are needed
  * Stool place for phone and computer ( not used in 2020 )
  * Cleaning poo off carpet is not fun. Ditto off walls
  * Move wastebaskets and any other possible targets around toilet out of the way
  * Bring a full bag of diapers
* When poo is squirting
  * Sit on toilet before taking off diaper
  * In shower cover butt with hand
* Looking for:
  * Clear yellow liquid yellow, light, liquid, and clear, like urine
  * No lumps but may be millimeter size particles and the add corn kernel
* The yellow liquid coats floor, hand, whatever with the most slippery substance known to mankind
  * Big increase to fall risk
  * Consider a non slip mat
  * Keep wiping rag in shower
* It gets cold being naked in there! So take hot showers every ten minutes. Wear tee shirt??
* Allow for urinating and final diaper change before leaving
