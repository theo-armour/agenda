Hello Amanda

Thank you for your visit this morning. I continue to be a devoted fan of PPH's in-home care, nonetheless, as we have discussed, I have gripes about the Elation Passport communication portal.

Here are a few of them:

* No Passport terms and conditions avail
* No links to agreements or contract information
* Cannot add a family member
* Cannot search messages
* Cannot address a message to PPH and copy a family member
* Cannot forward a reply from PPH to a family member or anybody else
* Clinical profile is a mess, out of date
* Not possible to follow status of communications between PPH and my specialists
* No connection to electronic health record (EHR) systems used by healthcare providers
* Irritating and not appropriate message appears at top of page each time Elation is loaded that for four years has bee telling me to download an iPhone app while I am on a Windows computer.
* The most frequent message I receive from Elation is: "Our office will be closed". If PPH supposed to be available 24/7, do you really need to tell me that your office will be closed - an office I will never ever step foot in.

I am, however, no expert in these matters. Therefore I asked Anthropic's ChatGPT o3 the following three questions:

1. What are the major features and benefits of a state-of-the-art portal Primary Care Practitioner HIPAA compliant online doctor-patient communication portal? Create the prompt. What do you need to know?

2. I am a patient of an in-home primary care provider in San Francisco, California. What are critical aspects I should be looking for in my providers online communication portal?

3. Are there aspects of preventative care and patient wellness that may be dealt with by my providers online communication portal?

I understand and accept that there is nothing you personally can do any of these issue. I do hope that you will share my message with the appropriate people. In my estimation the issues are of sufficient concern to be brought to the attention of people at the level of George Khasin, Payam Parvinchiha, Michael Genualdi and Liz Breen.

It would be awesome if the tech of PPH - in this tech-driven city - could begin to match the awesome personal care you and your colleagues have provided.
