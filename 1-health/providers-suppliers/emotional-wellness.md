Your website and your tweets are informative, engaging and friendly.

Are you available for a consultation?

I am a male living at the Heritage on the Marina, age 74, former registered architect now software developer building 3D apps. I find that I am now happier than I ever expected to be. I have accomplished many wonderful things

The matter at hand is curious. Â I find myself still searching for deep dialog with others that requires intellectual engagement. I still seek to be useful and provide service to others.

I have nearly a hundred close and dear friends here. Nonetheless the persons or persons of my dreams (fantasies?) seem just not to be available here. I seek to identify a roadmap for aging for myself and others like me.
