Hi Dr Yun

Since we last met, I visited https://www.ace-pt.com/ at 2238 Union Street and talked with staff there

I have also had a good look at the c;osest Select PT websitte: https://www.selectphysicaltherapy.com/contact/find-a-location/ca/san-francisco/san-franciscopacific-heights, but I did not get a chance to to walk over to their premises. I think it would take me half an hour or a bit more to get there.

The issue with both these organizations is that they are set up to bill medicare and insurance companies. Therefore they need injuries or post-op events in order to trigger payments. When I asked Ace about "coaching", they said thay did not offer such services.

At the other end of the spectrum there are all the fitness centers. The issue here is that they are generally equipped and trained to cater to younger, un-diabled people.

So I think what I am looking for is an online service that will enable a remote coach to zoom into my aratment and watch and coach,

I just looked at https://www.future.co/ - they seem "with it". Hah! They are iPhone only. Just like Pine Park...

Oh well

Theo
