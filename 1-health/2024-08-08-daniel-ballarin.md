Hi Daniel

Thank you for an engaging consultation this afternoon. Fingers crossed you get a Positive response From the powers that be.

A copy of an ISNCSCI form detailing the status of my neurological function is attached.

Just for fun here is a link to one of my projects where I helped a UK organization develop a way of creating low cost prosthetic limbs for children in developing countries.

The demo is broken at the moment but you can see the idea. It should be easy to fix if you atr interested
