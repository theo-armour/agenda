### Single-Use Scope for Colonoscopies

* <a href="https://www.aclsonline.us/blog/fda-clears-worlds-first-single-use-scope-for-colonoscopies/">https://www.aclsonline.us/blog/fda-clears-worlds-first-single-use-scope-for-colonoscopies/</a>
* The FDA granted approval this month for Invendo Medical to sell the world’s first single-use colonoscope. The new $200 sterile scope is expected to solve the problems associated with reprocessing scopes for colonoscopies.

### Pentax J10

* <a href="https://sites.pentaxmedical.com/eb-j10-series/p/1">https://sites.pentaxmedical.com/eb-j10-series/p/1</a>

both available on Ebay for under $7K. More reasonable than I expected. Got the Pentax J10 yet?

* Add ultrasound

Videos of the procedure on the way??

* Not now because of size
* Bogus issue: Average HD movie is 4GB. 16TB drives are $350 hold data for 4,000 procedures
* Will start to create a corpus of data which in turn will open way for AI

## Boston Bowel Prep Scale

* <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763922/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2763922/</a>

<blockquote>
  Each region of the colon receives a “segment score” from 0 to 3 and these segment scores are summed for a total BBPS score ranging from 0 to 9. Therefore, the maximum BBPS score for a perfectly clean colon without any residual liquid is 9 and the minimum BBPS score for an unprepared colon is 0

## 2023 Lessons Learned

* Simeticone (Gas-X) is your friend
* Wear non-slip socks

* 09:30 ~ prep finished

## 2023 ~ Lessons Learned

No poo on the walls, or carpet this time. Much more under control.

Possible reasons

* Much more well-rounded diet
* From Bran Buds every day to granola twice a week
* Half-dose Miralax every day ~ slipper stool
* Butt tightening exercises every day + less reduced pushing ~ more control over anus
* Three Simeticones before each prep session ~ less gas
* Swimming diapers prevent poo from getting out of control ~ fewer spills
* Equal prep and water + ginger ales

## 2020 ~ Lessons Learned

* "Explosive diarrhea - can hit a wall ten feet away ~ curiously no significant farting"
* Stop most high fiber items five days before
* No food for ~40 hours before
* White wine is a clear liquid
<li>Ditto ginger ale

</li>
* No need to take shower before prep ~ you will be taking many showers later

* Drink equal amounts of Prep|Gavilyte|GoLightly and water

* One glass of prep + one glass of water

* Prepare the bathroom

* Ensure no/zero/none trips out of the bathroom are needed

* Stool place for phone and computer ( not used in 2020 )

* Cleaning poo off carpet is not fun. Ditto off walls

* Move wastebaskets and any other possible targets around toilet out of the way

* Bring a full bag of diapers

* When poo is squirting

* Sit on toilet before taking off diaper

* In shower cover butt with hand

* Looking for:

* Clear yellow liquid yellow, light, liquid, and clear, like urine

* No lumps but may be millimeter size particles and the add corn kernel

* The yellow liquid coats floor, hand, whatever with the most slippery substance known to mankind

* Big increase to fall risk

* Consider a non slip mat

* Keep wiping rag in shower

* It gets cold being naked in there! So take hot showers every ten minutes. Wear tee shirt??

* Allow for urinating and final diaper change before leaving

## 2020-10-24

### First Purge ~ Tuesday after dinner

* Over an hour for prep
* A wait before first poo
* Explosive but lumps more than squirts
* May be able to leave bathroom a bit

### Second Purge ~ Wednesday morning after coffee breakfast

* An hour for prep
* Poo may begin before end of prep
* Poo squirts in an explosive manner - with a range of many feet
* Poo is yellow and clear at end, bit don't be fooled

### Third Purge ~ Thursday 8am

* Start 8am. Last poo just before 11am
* An hour for prep
* Poo begins before end of prep
* At beginning poo has small lumps, liquid is opaque brown
* Poos get smaller for the last hour

### Post Colonoscopy

* Be very careful
* Poo happens
* Sit on toilet and test every every hour until nothing appears

## 2020-10-21

Remember to drink equal amount of water.

Cushions in shower

Go sit in the shower for the duration. Second session may be more explosive than first.

It gets cold being naked in there! So take hot showers every ten minutes
