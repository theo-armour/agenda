# 2023-12-17 Brit Ongoing PT

Hi Brit

Thank you for stopping by this morning. I must say that I appreciate the close and ongoing support that EmpowerMe is providing to Heritage Residents.

As you know, I am currently working with Jonathan Liao in an effort to rehab the issues arising from breaking my femur last year. I understand these eventually these sessions will end.

Nonetheless, I will continue:

* to age
* to hunch over too much
* to put too much weight on my right arm when walking with a cane or walker because of the paralysis in my left leg
* To hobble awkwardly when walking without a cane
* to help deal with all the ongoing aches and pains.

I would like to continue to work with someone on an ongoing basis to address these issues.

* Someone to whom I can report my progress and who can help me with the next steps.
* Someone who can help me with the exercises that are tailored to my specific disabilities.
* Someone who can encourage me to do the exercises and to do them correctly.

It would be wonderful if you and EmpowerMe can help me with finding someone to "coach" me back to a more physically fit life.
