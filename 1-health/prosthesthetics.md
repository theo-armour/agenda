Hi Daniel

I'm getting device on on off easily enough. The nice thing is that I can And take it off without having to Take off my shirt .

I'm still trying to find a great use for it. Besides Thrilling others. Period I'm so used to using my stock for almost everything That using the new hand is not. The first thing that comes to mind. Period. I think a nice use will be that it helps balance my walking with a cane in a more natural way.

IIRC, With my previous prosthesis, it took three or four visits Perhaps more in order to arrive at Something I could try. I was surprised and delighted that we were able to accomplish. This task in only two visits.
