Hi Daniel

Acclimation: I'm getting device on on off easily enough. The nice thing is that I can And take it off without having to take off my shirt. My open and close control is settling down.

Uses: I'm still trying to find a great use for itâ€”besides thrilling others. Of course, I'm so used to using my stock for almost everything That using the new hand is not. The first thing that comes to mind. I think a nice use will be that it helps balance my walking with a cane in a more natural way.

Speedy Process: IIRC, With my previous prosthesis, it took three or four visits Perhaps more in order to arrive at Something I could try. I was surprised and delighted that we were able to accomplish. This task in only two visits.

Color: I'm thinking the same shade of gray as tho knobs on the device.

AI & Deep Learning: There are so many possibilities for prosthetic advancement. Do you know of anybody who is working on this?
