## General purpose of visit

Check skin for matters of interest that occur with long, full lives

## Symptoms of interest

### Head

* Hair
	* Scale city ~ Seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema ~ distracting, too much fun peeling off
	* Scaling has increased significantly over he past two years
	* Itchy frequently
	* Occasional inflammations
* Ears
	* Seems to produce a powder
* Nose out left side leaks something that scabs right away
* Eyebrows have little growies, ditto right cheek

### Body

* Rashes
	* Left elbow rash
	* Wherever tight fit: socks and diapers
	* Knee
	* Diaper
* Hives
	* Pop up every few weeks
	* 2 cm, hot, bright red, burning itch
	* (But could these be bug bites?)

### Skin generally

* More and more fascinating to look at
* Toe fungus
* Left heel scaling
* Single ingrown toenail: boo!
* Edema
* _Dermato fibroma_ ~ wart-like bumps ~ over a dozen removed, none recently
* _Keratosis pilaris_ ~ chicken skin ~ reduced symptoms with aging
* _Notalgia Paresthetica_ ~ scratchy area on back you can't reach


## Current personal plan of care


### Daily generally

* Trying to be skin microbiome aware and friendly
* Shower ever day
* No soap no shampoo
* No abrasives, scratching or brushing
* Mostly air dry, a bit of pat drying on unused area of a large towel
* If it itches, cream it: Aquaphor or Vick's Vapo Rub
* Also: Mediterranean, MIND diet and 6,000 steps per day with at leat 25 minutes at a good clip

### Weekly shampoo

* Kitoconazole
* Let sit on head for five to ten minutes
* Occasional Neutrogena 2% coal tar - helps with itching maybe

### Daily toe fungus and =lower leg care

* Ciclopirox helping - remove and repaint ones a week or so
* Slather on Vick's


## Observations

* The move from soaping and scraping skin to no soaping and air drying skin seems to have made little or no observable differences in the condition of my skin
	* But saves time and is better for the environment, so I will continue
* I think rashes and hives may be related to taking a proton-blocker (esomaprazole/nexium)
	* Commenced sone time after taking the proton blocker
	* Stool has an oil slick and smells rancid ~ steatorrhea?
	* Dietary fats not being process properly
	* Have neuropathy


## Requests

* Ciclopirox ~ new prescription or try something else
* Ketoconzole ~ new prescription or try something else

## questions

* Suggestions for plan of care?
* Would going bald help?
