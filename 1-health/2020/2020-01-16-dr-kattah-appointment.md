Big picture
* Three years since you spotted the bad boy
* Perhaps the three best years of my life - coding, living, loving all AOK
* Walk 45 minutes most every day, diet is Mediterranean, alcohol getting better, weight ditto

Current status
* No dark stool or blood loss incidents since December when I experimented with reducing daily Omeprazole
* Hernia repair 2019 and hip replacement 2015 are dim memories
* Tingling and rashes seen to have reduced with the switch esomaprazole
* Started taking iron but keeping stool loose is a priority over iron's constipation

Big questions
* Why am I taking esomaprozele? For sure there's dysphagia and bleeding. But are there terms I can search for and learn about?
* Are tingling (neuropathy?), diziness and rashes, hives(?) connected with diet and connected with rancid, slicky stool (steatorrhea?) ?
* Are there other solutions to explore besides proton-blockers?

Small questions
* Is taking 15 mg of apple cider vinegar in a glass of water twice a day OK?
* Where can I find a diet/nutrition coach/mentor
* Is *not* taking low dose aspirin OK?

Three cheers
* For publishing papers available to the public at no charge
* For doing stuff I could never do on an ongoing, daily basis
* Iron and constipation
* stool
* Pill I'm taking

OK for

* Esomaprazole 20mg OK / reduce prescription
* Water with apple cider vinigar


The only significant current issues are the ongoing tingling feet (and sometimes lower body), occasional light-headed feeling, a weird "eyes heel heavy" symptom. These occur mostly in the morning before I have eaten much and while sitting at the computer. None of these seem to impede my daily routines in any significant manner - apart from the minor worry they cause.

The symptoms do not cause me to be breathless, or disturb my ability to read small text on screen or stop me from coding or type all day. They may be more apparent the day after drinking four or five portions of alcohol.

The other interesting symptom is soft loose stool with 2mm to 5mm air pockets ( think of the holes in a sponge or miniature Swiss cheese). It leaves a whitish scum or slick and has a slightly rancid smell and is occasionally expressed explosively.

The less interesting symptoms are psoriasis and rashes in varying locations - which I medicate by slathering on Aquaphore cream.

 I stopped taking probiotics, prebiotics, aspirin and vitamins some time last year.

Concerns
