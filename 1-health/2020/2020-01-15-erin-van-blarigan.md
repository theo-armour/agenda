## Succeed Study

p3 > Thus, we developed a website with a simple diet tracking tool and a 12-week text messaging program to help individuals with CRC make
recommended dietary changes.

I felt the diet tracking tools were very time-consuming, offered choices that did not relate to my actual or goals, dis not provide feedback, did not allow me to download and save my results. Engaging with ASA24 and RESCap - in this era of well-designed, fluid apps - were both truly awful outdated and time-wating experiences.

Imagine a FitBit app where you had to punch in all the numbers, the results went to FitBit but not to you.

p3 >  Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted in accordance with recognized ethical guidelines ... and approved by the institutional review board of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).


p4 > The website was designed to be used on a computer, tablet, or phone and built on the
UCSF Drupal 8 infrastructure.

Link not included in paper. https://succeed.ucsf.edu/. Still has same static splash screen image

And I am even more dissatisfied with it.


p4 >  See Supplemental Figure 1a-1d for screenshots of the website.

Not included in the PDF I see


p5 >  See Supplemental Table 1 for the first 14 text messages.

I only see six messages in the PDF I received

p8 > While the intervention appeared feasible and acceptable, a number of aspects could be improved. The optimal frequency of website use/diet tracking to achieve dietary change is not known (35,36). It is possible that less frequent tracking is needed to change intake of food groups, such as whole grains, compared to managing calorie intake for weight loss.

Fitbit and similar apps allow you to track whenever you wish and make it easy to do so. Next time build a plugin that that is a Fitbit or similar addon.


> Additionally, a key area for improvement is personalization of text messages. Advances in technology, including artificial intelligence, hold promise for tailoring messages while maintaining scalability.

Personalization would be a huge plus. No AI needed. Simple look up tables needed. If patient is male, single and over 70 you need not supply recipes for six people. if patient is member of family of six then a recipe sharing one avocado may be insufficient.


> In addition, it would be of interest to test the independent effect of text messages in a future
study using a multi-arm or factorial design.

For me the messages tended to be repetitive and simplistic. For others thre messages might have been judgmental or pontificating.

> In conclusion, we developed a web-based dietary intervention for CRC survivors. Our pilot results suggest
CRC survivors may engage more with text messages than a study website. Research to improve tailoring of
text messages, while maintaining scalability, is needed.

I note that there is a single URL in the entire paper. It happens to be to www.twilio.com - a world leader in text messaging with headquarters in close proximity to UCSF.
