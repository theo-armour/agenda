Move to Heritage

* Don't have to worry about growing old. Everything taken of.
* Very happy with move. Good decision
* Nonetheless, requires much adaptation - see below

Urinalysis

* Bacteria
* WB count?
* I can observe light colored "things" in the urine

Neuropathy

* Diminishing with diet/move changes maybe
* Or am I getting used to it?
* May be alcohol consumption related
* Pre-diabetic related?


Stool

* Inky colored water surrounding the stool
* Foamy ~ air pockets in the stool
* Much more solid recently because of diet change ~ see below 

PT

Skin

* Continue to have rashes and scales in hair ~ slather daily with Triamcinolone Acetonide


Medications
