"These are not yet solutions. But they are places to dig." - [Brit Marling]( https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/opinion/sunday/brit-marling-women-movies.html )

* Avoiding bad food and seeking good advice
	* High-glycemic, salts, nitrites, bad cholesterol, FODMAP
	* Separating wheat from chaff is just as important while reading
* A diet that supplies all needed nutrients
	* Probiotic without the probiotics
	* Prebiotic without the prebiotics
	* Vitamins without pills
* Food that supports a health micribiome all the way down and out
	* There is a reason why we are called "old farts"
* A diet that helps weight loss
	* Calories, exercise, fasting, timing
* Food that is filling
	* Feeling hungry with no available satisfaction is no fun
* Food that tastes good, that brings delight
	* Every palette is different
* Recipes for person by person
	* A recipe for six people is not useful for a single person
	* Meals for skinny people may differ than meals for fat people
* Meals that can be prepared within a given time allocated
	* It may be hours, it may be minutes, but needs possibilities for all
	* Allow for capabilities and disabilities
* Actual products you can buy - that are readily obtainable
	* Foods you want to eat frequently should be available from places within a short walk
* A diet that travels, is portable, can fit in anywhere in the world
	* And can be adapted too wherever at a moment's notice
