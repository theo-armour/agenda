To summarize your visit your symptoms and history is most consistent with:

* The leg symptoms best with bilateral sciatic neuropathy or bilateral L5 radiculopathy. Since the symptoms our intermittent and your walking and function is not affected,
* Your abdomen symptoms are difficult to characterize. Since they don't seem to be associated with other symptoms, I am not concerned about them right now. If they get worse I would consider whether they could be due to "referred pain" meaning that an abdominal problem such as a urinary injection or constipation is causing a vague pain sensation.

Your Care Instructions

The sciatic nerves and their branches extend down through the buttock to the foot. Sciatica can develop when an injured disc in the back irritates or presses against a spinal nerve root. Its main symptom is pain, numbness, or weakness that is often worse in the leg or foot than in the back.

Sciatica often will improve and go away with time. Early treatment usually includes medicines and exercises to relieve pain.

Use heat or ice to relieve pain.

To apply heat, put a warm water bottle, heating pad set on low, or warm cloth on your back. Do not go to sleep with a heating pad on your skin.

To use ice, put ice or a cold pack on the area for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. Put a thin cloth between the ice and your skin.

Avoid sitting if possible, unless it feels better than standing.

Alternate lying down with short walks. Increase your walking distance as you are able to without making your symptoms worse.

Do not do anything that makes your symptoms worse.
