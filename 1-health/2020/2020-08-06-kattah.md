```
we praise the colorectal surgeon
misunderstood and much maligned
slaving away in the heart of darkness
working where the sun don't shine
respect the colorectal surgeon
it's a calling you would crave
lift up your hands and join us
let's all do the finger wave
when it comes to spreading joy there are many techniques
some spread joy through the world and others just spread cheeks
some may think the cardiologist is their best friend
but the colorectal surgeon knows he'll get you in the end
why be a colorectal surgeon
it's one of those mysterious things
is it because in that profession
there are always openings
when i first met a colorectal surgeon
he did not quite understand
i said hi it's nice to meet you
but do you mind we don't shake hands
he sailed right through medical school because he was a wiz
oh but he never thought of psychology though he read passages
a doctor he wanted to be for golf he loved to play
but this is not quite what he meant by eighteen holes a day
we praise the colorectal surgeon
misunderstood and much maligned
slaving away in the heart of darkness
working where the sun don't shine
