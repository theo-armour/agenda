I worry about seeing such as an accident where I fall and break my right arm and life is completely turned topsy-turvy

I've been walking successfully with a cane for about 25 years. but in 2022 I broke my left femur. subsequently I have been putting much more weight on my right hand holding the cane.

Wwhat can I do to prevent further injury to my right wrist when walking with a cane?


should I get a prosthesis? 

what is a good "handy" website?

Am I doing the right exercises?

My right hand keeps falling asleep I believe that it's cause by some issue in my shoulder but I am only a humble patient. should I worry about this? what can I do to reduce this?

here are some of the exercises I do

when I wake up in the morning: I Make a fist, wiggle and stretch my fingers for about a minute or two or so

during my 20 minutes or so of exercise at a number of points I stretch my fingers and make a fist

while waiting for the urine come out of the catheter I rotate my thumb while holding onto a pole

after my afternoon nap I do some simple arm exercises with a 5-pound weight

went on a telephone call I try to remember to use a 5 lb weight and wiggle my hand
