I worry about seeing such as an accident where I fall and break my right arm and life is completely turned topsy-turvy

I've been walking successfully with a cane for about 25 years. But in 2022 I broke my left femur. subsequently I have been putting much more weight on my right hand whilw holding the cane.

What can I do to prevent further injury to my right wrist when walking with a cane?

Should I get a prosthesis? 

What is a good "handy" website? For learning about stretches, exerises.

Am I doing the right exercises?

My right hand keeps falling asleep I believe that it's cause by some issue in my shoulder but I am only a humble patient. should I worry about this? what can I do to reduce this?

Here are some of the exercises I do

When I wake up in the morning: I make a fist, wiggle and stretch my fingers for about a minute or two or so

During my 20 minutes or so of exercise at a number of points I stretch my fingers and make a fist

While waiting for the urine come out of the catheter I rotate my thumb while holding onto a pole

After my afternoon nap I do some simple arm exercises with a 5-pound weight

While on a telephone call, I try to remember to wiggle my hand while rotting a 5 lb weight
