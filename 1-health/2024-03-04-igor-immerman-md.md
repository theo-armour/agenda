I worry about seeing such as an accident where I fall and break my right arm and life is completely turned topsy-turvy

should I get a prosthesis? 

what is a good "handy" website?

My right hand keeps falling asleep I believe that it's cause by some issue in my shoulder but I am only a humble patient. should I worry about this? what can I do to reduce this?

here are some of the exercises I do

when I wake up in the morning: I Make a fist, wiggle and stretch my fingers for about a minute or two or so
