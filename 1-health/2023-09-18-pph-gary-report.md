## General Questions

Is there an available checklist of things we could be recording and doing to maintain our health and wellness? How can you help us to be good and interesting patients? ;-)

Do you know anybody who is skilled with using devices such as digital scales, blood pressure monitors and other similar devices and could act as a coach or mentor in their use?

What are three books we could have in the library to help people in their eighties and nineties with their health and wellness?

Would it be useful to have a dermatologist clinic onsite at Heritage on the Marina once a year and see a number of residents. Similar to successful the ENT clinic we just had.

One of my side hustles: Collaborate on a project to design, build and disseminate a dimensions of wellness app for the elderly. The app woul provide questions for you to answer to help you monitor and report on your aging process
