**Subject: Improvements Needed for Elation Passport**

Hello Amanda,

Thank you for your visit this morning. My respect for PPH’s in-home care remains solid, but the Elation Passport portal is still far below the standard patients should expect in 2025. The following gaps directly impede my care and family coordination:

* **No published terms, conditions, or link to our service agreement**
* **No option to add or authorize family caregivers**
* **No message search or filter function**
* **No way to copy family members on messages to PPH or forward your replies**
* **Clinical profile inaccurate and badly outdated**
* **No visibility into PPH-specialist correspondence or referral status**
* **No integration with the EHR systems my specialists use**
* **Persistent banner urging an iPhone app—even on Windows—unprofessional and distracting**
* **Frequent “Our office will be closed” blasts that contradict PPH’s 24/7 promise**

These are not minor annoyances; they chip away at continuity of care, patient safety, and the transparency a home-bound patient depends on. They have remained undealt with ever since I first came on board.

To ensure my expectations were reasonable, I asked ChatGPT-o3 to outline the features of a top-tier, HIPAA-compliant primary-care portal.

My questions

1. What are the major features and benefits of a state-of-the-art portal Primary Care Practitioner HIPAA compliant online doctor-patient communication portal? Create the prompt. What do you need to know?

2. I am a patient of an in-home primary care provider in San Francisco, California. What are critical aspects I should be looking for in my providers online communication portal?

3. Are there aspects of preventative care and patient wellness that may be dealt with by my providers online communication portal?

Here is link to ChatGPT's replies

Against that benchmark, Elation Passport is years behind.

I realize you cannot fix the portal yourself, but these issues warrant escalation to leadership—specifically George Khasin, Payam Parvinchiha, Michael Genualdi, and Liz Breen. PPH operates in the world’s tech capital; its digital tools should match the excellence of the clinical care you and your colleagues deliver every day.

Please let me know how I may help move this forward.

Warm regards,

Theo
