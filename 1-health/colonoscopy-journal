### Prep

* No granola for five days
* No solid food for 40 hours
* Burmese dinner two days before: OK

* For each glass of fluid, drink a glass of water
* 15 minutes per session
* 12:25 ~ start
* 12:45
* 1:00
* 1:25
* 1:45
* Finished around 3:30

### First Pass Comments

* Took three Simethicone tablets before starting
* Tablets worked at first but midway became nauseous
* No fun: trapped gas and some dry heaves
* Did not take the anti-nausea pill
* I had several gas-driven explosive bowel movements
* Splatters on the wall, floor, scale, toilet, catheters and me
* I had was not sitting with my butt to the toilet when dropping the diaper
* Swimming diapers are a must
* they contain the wet poo much better than my regular diapers
* I did not use the shower

### Second Pass

* Started around 8:00
* Finished around 11:00
* Same fluid routine
* Stand while drinking
* Sit on toilet while waiting
* I took one Simethicone table every hour ~ four total
* Gas was under much better control
* No explosions and no nausea
* Liquid can out in controlled flows when I pushed

### Aftermath

* Set alarm for 1:00 am to pee and check for poo
* Got up at 5:00 to pee and check for poo
* No poo on the carpet
* Only a small bit on the bed pad
* No bed accidents

### Outcome

* Doing entire procedure the night before is good
* Bowel prep results excellent

### Procedure

* Dr Kattah was as affable as ever
* Joke: "Why isn't AI good for colonoscopy? Because it can't find the back end."
* Four polyps found and removed
* No pain during procedure

### Equipment

* Fujifilm EC-760S-V/L colonoscope used

### Lessons Learned

* Prevent bad things: Aim butt first ~ drop "trou" second
* Control the gas: Simethicone is your friend
* Control the leaks: Swimming diapers are a must
* Reduce the cleanup: clear the deck
* Give it time: Allow 12 hours for the process
* Be comfortable: Use cloth bed pads
* Bowel prep in summer is much warmer than winter ~ naked is OK

## 2023 ~ Lessons Learned

No poo on the walls, or carpet this time. Much more under control.

Possible reasons

* Much more well-rounded diet
* From Bran Buds every day to granola twice a week
* Half-dose Miralax every day ~ slipper stool
* Butt tightening exercises every day + less reduced pushing ~ more control over anus
* Three Simethicones before each prep session ~ less gas
* Swimming diapers prevent poo from getting out of control ~ fewer spills
* Equal prep and water + ginger ales

## 2020 ~ Lessons Learned

* "Explosive diarrhea - can hit a wall ten feet away ~ curiously no significant farting"
* Stop most high fiber items five days before
* No food for ~40 hours before
* White wine is a clear liquid
* Ditto ginger ale
* No need to take shower before prep ~ you will be taking many showers later
* Drink equal amounts of Prep|Gavilyte|GoLightly and water
  * One glass of prep + one glass of water
* Prepare the bathroom
  * Ensure no/zero/none trips out of the bathroom are needed
  * Stool place for phone and computer ( not used in 2020 )
  * Cleaning poo off carpet is not fun. Ditto off walls
  * Move wastebaskets and any other possible targets around toilet out of the way
  * Bring a full bag of diapers
* When poo is squirting
  * Sit on toilet before taking off diaper
  * In shower cover butt with hand
* Looking for:
  * Clear yellow liquid yellow, light, liquid, and clear, like urine
  * No lumps but may be millimeter size particles and the add corn kernel
* The yellow liquid coats floor, hand, whatever with the most slippery substance known to mankind
  * Big increase to fall risk
  * Consider a non slip mat
  * Keep wiping rag in shower
* It gets cold being naked in there! So take hot showers every ten minutes. Wear tee shirt??
* Allow for urinating and final diaper change before leaving
