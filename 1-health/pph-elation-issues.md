# PPH Elation Issues


Replying to a message with an attachment

I received a message with an attachment (a lab report )

I drafted a lengthy reply. In order to check on on my thoughts I clicked on the link to the attachment. The attachment opened on top of my draft. When I pressed the browser back button my message was no longer there.
