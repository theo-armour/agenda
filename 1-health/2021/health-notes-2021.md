From Dr Martin

One benefit of the Geriatrics Center is longer appointments with more support from nurses, social workers, etc.
Unfortunately, I think they take patients 75+ and do not believe any of their providers are currently taking new patients, but you could reach out to their office to confirm.

Personally, I do not think you are "geriatric enough" to need the extra support services they offer (yet).  Also, one of the physicians in our office is board-certified in geriatrics, Dr. Pratyusha Narra.  She is open to take new geriatric patients on a case-by-case basis so I could talk with her as another option.

I hope the above information is helpful in your decision.

Hi Sandra

Prior to residing at the Heritage, I received all my immunizations at Walgreens. In all cases, Walgreens notified my PCP that an immunization occurred and my medical records at UCDF were updated accordingly. I appreciated very much that this system was efficient, effective and accurate. I also felt secure that my "future-self" - probably forgetful - would be well looked after.

Now that I reside at the Heritage, I wonder: is the same process workable here when residents are immunized on the premises?

Is it possible for Heritage contractors such as Safeway and CVS to notify residents' PCPs directly of any immunizations?

Hi Dr Martin

Several residents here at the Heritage on the Marina are under the care of the UCSF Center for Geriatric Care.

Learning about this and being a disabled senior, my interest has been piqued.

Please know that your care for me is warm, professional and "successful" and I am very thankful for this.

I am wondering if you might offer any pros and cons regarding a change of PCP from you to the Center - given I enjoy proactive, preventative, experimental, research-oriented care.
