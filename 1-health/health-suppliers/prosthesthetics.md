Comfort: Generally: quite comfortable; feels cozy. Walking with my arm in the socket while leaning on the armrest of an upright walker may be less comfortable.

Battery Life: Very much better than expected. I'm still on the first charge.

Observability: Virtually nobody notices that I'm wearing a prosthesis. In particular even the people that know me well and have heard that I was going to the second hand store.

Extra weight: The newly added weight is noticeable, but not bothersome. It may help with posture and balance while walking with a cane.

Safety Aid: At times the newly-extended arm length allows me to stand safely further away from whatever I am using to stabilize my position, for example the safety pole in the bathroom.

## 2024-10-29 ~ Prosthesis Update

Hi Daniel

Acclimation: I'm getting device on on off easily enough. The nice thing is that I can And take it off without having to take off my shirt. My open and close control is settling down.

Uses: I'm still trying to find a great use for itâ€”besides thrilling others. Of course, I'm so used to using my stock for almost everything That using the new hand is not. The first thing that comes to mind. I think a nice use will be that it helps balance my walking with a cane in a more natural way.

Speedy Process: IIRC, With my previous prosthesis, it took three or four visits Perhaps more in order to arrive at Something I could try. I was surprised and delighted that we were able to accomplish. This task in only two visits.

Color: I'm thinking the same shade of gray as tho knobs on the device.

AI & Deep Learning: There are so many possibilities for prosthetic advancement. Do you know of anybody who is working on this?
