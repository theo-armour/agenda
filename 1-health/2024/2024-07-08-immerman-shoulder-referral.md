# 2024-07-08 Immerman Shoulder Referral

Hello Dr Immerman

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our appointment from March 4, 2024, regarding the numbness in my right hand. It was suggested that I see a shoulder specialist. I would like to follow up on that suggestion.

Would you kindly refer me to a shoulder specialist associated with you at the UCSF Orthopaedic Institute?

Thank you for your time and continued support in addressing my health concerns. I look forward to your response and any additional guidance you may have.

Theo
