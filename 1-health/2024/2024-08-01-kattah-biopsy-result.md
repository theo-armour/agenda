Dear Norman Armour,

You recently underwent a colonoscopy and removal of a polyp or polyps with the UCSF Gastroenterology (GI) Division. The polyps were analyzed by a pathologist, and found to be:
Tubular adenoma and Sessile serrated adenoma

These types of polyps are not cancer. Taking into account your history, number, and type of polyps identified, the most current U.S. Multi-Society Task Force guidelines recommend that you have another colonoscopy in: 2 years

You do NOT have cancer, these are the usual kind of "pre-cancerous" polyps that we typically find. However, at this point, given that we find several every time we do your colonosocpy,  I think you have some type of polyposis syndrome that is not-otherwise specified. I think repeating every 2 years makes sense. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about that.

Please discuss these results with your primary care provider as they should refer you for another colonoscopy when appropriate.  This is very important to reduce your risk of developing colon cancer in the future.

It was my sincere pleasure to take care of you. If you have any further questions about your colonoscopy please feel free to contact the GI office at 415-502-4444 from 8AM-5PM Monday through Friday, or send a message via MyChart.
