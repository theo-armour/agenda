Hi Lauren

Thanks for your message. Some thoughts on your message:


Insurance Coverage
Even though a good number of residents might seek your services, for many Heritage residents a fee of $250 would be higher than what they used used to paying.

In order to help bring them on board, it might be helpful to identify insurance policies that would defray the cost of your services.

I understand that you are not part of any network and that you do not accept insurance. I hope with your good years of experience you can offer sone helpful observations and advice.

I am looking this Delta Dental plan comparison:

Can you tell me if the PPO Basic plan would cover the fee your hygienist services for a normal exam and cleaning?

In my own case, I do not currently have any dental insurance and my teeth require deep gum cleaning/periodontal maintenance. Would you have any idea how I might best be covered by insurance as related to your fees?

Next Visit
I understand that will will be visiting here in the next few weeks. I will sign up for your introductory exam. I have a cleaning scheduled for December 6th with current provider at UCSF, but we will talk about future visits. Also, I understand that Pine Park have given their OK for you to proceed with any necessary work.

**Subject:** Inquiry About Insurance Coverage and Upcoming Visit

Hi Lauren

Thanks for your message. Some thoughts on your message:

**Insurance Coverage**
While I believe many residents may benefit from your services, I also recognize that for some Heritage residents, a fee of $250 may be higher than they are accustomed to paying.

To help make your services more accessible, it might be beneficial to identify any insurance policies that could offset the cost.

I understand that you are not part of any insurance network and do not directly accept insurance. However, given your extensive experience, I hope you can share any helpful insights or advice.

I’m currently reviewing the following Delta Dental plan comparison:

Could you let me know if the PPO Basic plan would cover your fee for a standard exam and cleaning?

In my case, I currently do not have dental insurance, and I require deep gum cleaning/periodontal maintenance. Do you have any recommendations for insurance plans or approaches that might help cover your fees for these services?

**Next Visit**
I understand you’ll be visiting here in the coming weeks, and I plan to sign up for an exam. I already have a cleaning scheduled for December 6th with my current provider at UCSF, but I’d like to discuss potential future visits with you during your visit.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
