Hello Team Elenker

I am on my third Elenker Upright Walker. They have been great and  affordable walkers. I have assisted three friends in purchasing their own upright walkers. Thank you for a very good product

The issue that I have is that when I stand up straight my knees bump into the seat - even when the seat is all the way forward.

The result is that I stand back from the seat in order to walk without hitting my knees and so, I am hunching over. This is stressing my back and arms.

My question is: would it be possible to order a custom walker with a more shorter or narrower seat that is 2-3 inches further forward? Or would it be possible to order a custom version with the arm rests further back?

Cheers,

Theo
