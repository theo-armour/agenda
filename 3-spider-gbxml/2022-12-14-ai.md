The situation with AI is a fast-unfolding fantasy. It's not science fiction. It's science non-fiction

We have lived through a biological virus. Little did we know that we were also living in the midst of a technological virus. They both spread faster than priced nd fr more widely than anticipated. 

From my perspective, the surprise of the creativity, the ingenuity, the cleverness of what is appearing. The output is so precisely on target, that when there is a miss, it's correctable by adjusting the prompt.

I have already used chaGPT to create programs that run in my favorite 3D library. Here is the interesting thing: ChatGPT only knows how to output text. It has no way of showing images, let alone 3D animations. So I tell it to write a JavaScript - which it does. Then I save the script to my computer, run it in my browser and presto, the magic happens.

Where it's going to go mystifies me, but it's both scary and exhilarating at t he same time. My dream:

The elimination of drudgery - all mindless, repetitive drudgery will be eliminated. People will concentrate on things that interest them.

The apparition of alternatives you had never thought of

Identification of falsehoods

new beauty

better imagination - kant perception
