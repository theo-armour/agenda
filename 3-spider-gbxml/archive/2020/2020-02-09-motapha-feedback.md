I like the topics but I would suggest a different order of importance. This is super self-centered on our projects so feel free to ignore the comments where it doesn't make sense.

Accesses, lists folders on GitHub with Sample files of the following types gbXML, Honeybee Schema JSON, Dragonfly Schema JSON, RAD, OBJ, STL, GLTF, FBX and perhaps more
I like the idea of having a viewer that can load all these types but I'm not sure if that will be called honeybee viewer. Also I would make Dragonfly Schema priority over the rest since I think there are already viewers available for other file types.

Enables opening, displaying and saving assemblies of all the above file types
Same comment as above

Access maps images, terrain data and adjacent building data and add to assemblies
A site loader is a great idea and is pretty on demand. I know you have done it before and my comment has always been if we want it to be useful for real project it should be realistic. I know make them look good you sometimes exaggerate the z values.

Add Sun range, analaemmas and and similar
Sunpath is a better name for analemma. To me this is also not high priority for the viewer but it is nice to have once it has the full functionality.

Allow for building changes such as openings and shades being open or closed
This is also cool and to me goes closer to the bottom of the list. If we want to do it as part of result visualization that will be a different story.

Allow for coloring, texturing and animating any surface using data supplied by engineering apps
This is high priority. I don't know about textures but coloring control based on data is a must.

Add Git or Git-line capabilities to all files
I would say this is not the job of a viewer unless you are thinking to use this for running diff between two 3D models. Now that is pretty useful and cool.

Enable projects to look pretty and be accessible for normal people
Pretty is good! Not sure what does that mean technically.

Encourage use of data simplifications such as gbXML to be useful for envisaging piping, escape routes, signage etc
No comments on this. I don't have a stake in gbXML really.

Generate new data files as parametric components
I think this will be useful if the generator is less random and more about rules. Like what you mentioned about building typologies.

Provide seamless linking two way between 3D models and JSON or source data
This is to me the most important at this point. @chriswmackey, I had a call with @theo-armour today and it seems adding UUID to each clickable object will make Thoe's life much easier to make this to work. I know we have this conversation going in some other issue. This is FYI.
