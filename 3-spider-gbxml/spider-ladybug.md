TL;DR

Spider gbbXML Viewer v0.17 'Maevia' provides a significant leap forward in terms of performance, usability and robustness.


gbXML files are the AEC industry standard for communicating data between CAD programs such as Revit, AutoCAD , Bentley MicroCAD and energy analysis programs such as Open Studio, Energy Plus, Sefaira, TAS and others. The upcoming Spider gbbXML Viewer v0.17 - code name 'Maevia' makes managing gbXML files faster, simpler and with higher quality transfers

Problems to be solved


## Any good software


### Polyglotism

**Problem**: We live in a connected world. Data may arrive from anywhere at any time. Systems that force you to download a file or limit you to opening file on a remote server or use another app to decompress data are problems not solutions .

**Want/Need**: Opening files is not an issue. You may open any file, of any type, from any source, anywhere, any time.

**Solution**: Spider is good at opening gbXML files and making the data usable for you. The file open module deals with data files that may be local or remote, 8 bit/single or 16bit/double-byte, in ASCII or ZIP format, small or hundreds of megabytes, working or broken, loaded once or repeatedly with a click, readable as text, as XML, as JSON or in 3D. And you open most files are loaded in a second or two.

**Importance**: This is a nice to have. It won't change the world, but every app should have this. And since file-open-basic.js is on GitHug, what are you waiting for?


### Device independent

**Problem:** You have a thing you are interested in but you are traveling, at home, have lost you computer, without power or whatever, but that does not stop the problem from being interesting and you want to find a solution.

**Want/Need**: handling problems is not an issue. You can access your data on any device, anywhere, any time. Today's mantra is "Mobile first!"

**Solution**: Spider runs from a server or runs locally, online or off line, standalone or embedded in an iframe. Spiders run on a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone. If you have access to a browser you can manipulate gbXML.

**Importance**. Unknown. Current building engineering is mostly carried in offices with access high-powered desktops or laptops for big, expensive long-term projects. The
future may bring more light width ad-hoc field engineering where you pull the folding phone out of your cargo-pants and decide the R-value of the gunk inside the 3D building printer for an acoustic shell behind this afternoon's rock concert.



### Forgiving / "Use the Force, Luke"

**Problem**: Files are huge, complex, have errors and of of inconsistent content

**Want/Need**: A file reader that is forgiving, makes the date understandable, works fast and is fun to play with

**Solution**: Billions of dollars and zillions of hours have been spent making your browser work fast. Spider harnesses that power to read huge files into memory - even if they happen to break rules

**Importance**: Decreasing. Because of industries such as gaming, pornography and advertising, the browser is rendering faster than we can think. At some time is the future even the slowest app will appear faster than we can think.



### Auditable

**Problem**: The system has given you an answer, but you need to know that the answer is authoritative, verifiable and beneficial.

**Want/Need**: Answers and solutions that are trustworthy. Built on FOSS, few dependencies

**Solution**: Spider is built on Three.js, PKZip.js and Showdown.js. Plus several dozen in-house modules all written in plain-vanilla JavaScript. There are no other dependencies. All of the above are plain vanilla open source JavaScript files available for inspection on GitHub.

**Importance**: Unknown. At some time in the future all programs may be some AI neural network thingies. On the other hand maybe programming becomes things like strumming a guitar or combing your hair.




### Speedy execution

**Problem**: Going from one tab or window to another tab or window and then returning to the first tab or window is boring, frustrating and old-skool. Fixing the design takes longer than designing the design. Every keystroke is it takes to do something is a keystroke slowing down better engineering

**Want/Need**: Every click in your current tab just keeps new things coming into your current tab. The menu trees just make this happen for you

**Problem**: Spider is designed for you to see, review and fix with as few keystrokes as possible while giving you the maximum feedback, timeliness and direction.





## Code remixing


### Not Distracting

**Problem**: Solving building engineering problems and creating elegant solutions is time-consuming, expensive and complicated. We are working with complex building engineering concepts and these take up most of our thought processing capabilities. Code of any complexity makes you spend more time analyzing the code than analyzing the building design.

**Want/Need**: methods where we spend time on the engineering not the coding or programming

**Solution**: The code in Spider 'Maevia' The actual code for visualizing and investigating should not slow down
Coding style follows Mr.doob Three.js coding style very closely. In other words code should look good as good as a poem on a page.

**Importance**




### Hackability

**Problem**: We have entered an era where programming apps for the browser has become a highly sophisticated, directed and all consuming affair. People with excellent STEM skills but limited coding skills a afraid to start. Full stack developers excellent in a particular workflow such as Angular may cringe at the idea of working with Vue or React.

**Want/Need**: tool as are hackable by people with all manner of skill sets and at all levels of skill mastery.

**Solution**: Spider is designed to be easy for beginners to hack using the Windows Notepad or MacOS TextEdit or the GitHub online editor and easy for full stack developers to port into complex, existing workflows.

* [Hackability - What it means, why it’s important]( https://www.slideshare.net/nitot/hackability-what-it-means-why-its-important/ )



### Workflow adaptable

**Problem**: Every organization, every discipline, every project may have its own work flow, web presence methodology, look and feel. Having to adapt to new methods is a deal breaker

**Want**: Tools that adapt to your current needs rather than the reverse. Your needs are complex. They range from appearance to performance, from security to economic value

**Solution**: Spider is easy to theme. Demos for Bootstrap and W3Schools theme provided. Spider is easy to embed. Demos for embedding Spider in an iframe are provide



## gbXML Specific


### Error repair

**Problem**. You receive many gbXML files with many issues. In other words, you receive files of hundreds of thousands lines with hundred of errors. The process of repairing the files is done by humans and is drudgery, complicated and expensive.

**Want/Need**: Files that can fix themselves.

**Solution**: Spider has eight routines for checking for issues and nine modules that identify issues and can fix the issues with a click of a single button

**Importance**: This is it. Fix the files and get on with it. Files that make the round trip between energy analysis and CAD apps are worth their weight in copper pipes or something.



### In depth Views

**Problem**: gbXML files typically contain many elements including surfaces, spaces, stories, zones, constructions, materials and many more. Any one of these may have issies

**Want/Need**: the ability to view any and all elements in a gbXML file

**Solution**: Spider provides the tools to view every instance in every element with a few keystrokes. For example, surface elements may be located using ID, name, construction or CAD Object ID. Once located, the attributes of the surface may be viewed as clickable items, a raw gbXML or as 3D representation highligted un the 3D model

Relevance: Very important. Spiders ability to locate an element, highlight it, view it;s detail, zoom into it, show its neighbors and more are the things that make Maeva useful, speedy and fun.



### Effectiveness

**Problem**: You have to know Revit, AutoCAD, Open Studio, TAS and a bunch of other programs. You have to download, install and keep them up to date. Most engineering apps are programs you have to download, install and update. Then you have watch innumerable podcasts in order to get going.

**Want/Need**: easy to use, free, just works. Easy to re-purpose

Solution. Spider: it just works. If you can use the menus in a browser you can use Spider. If you have something that take two clicks and yu ask us, we can probably make it happen in one click.

Relevance: All apps 'should just work'. So this category in the future should nor be important. But for th moment Spider is a good early adopter.



## Learnability

### Documentation

Documentation

In code documentation: inline comments are rare. Often they merely indicate the beginning and end of a logical grouping of functions. The bigger, deeper effort is going into the naming of variable, function, files and folders Every module has its own name space.



Every module has an associated read me file written in Markdown format. fileName.js has fileName.md. Every read me incorporates module mission/vision/problem-being-solved, wish list, issues, links of interest and change log. Automating the process of updating - ( think jsDOc, aspects of YAML and so on ) of the module read me is a work-in-progress


### Sample Data

**Problem**: People have to start somewhere but there is nothing there to start with. Data to learn from or for testing is not available

**Want/Need**: Sample data for learning, testing and manipulating

**Solution**: Spider provides dozens of sample gbXML files for you to practice with

[Importance of Sampling in the Era of Big Data]( https://towardsdatascience.com/importance-of-sampling-in-the-era-of-big-data-d2cf83e06c6a )



### Extensible product Portfolio

**Problem**: Users hate change


**Solution**: We are EPP. All versions are online

## 2019-06-03 ~

This message is to express the appreciation of BuroHappold oby the Ladybug Tools / Spider team for the ongoing contributions of Michal Dengusiak in helping us build better tools for viewing, editing and fixing gbXML files.

Michal  has helped us design a better user interface, identify bugs and identify calculations issues. His devotion over evening and weekends since 2017 has helped us build web applications now used daily by dozens of professional engineers around the world to carry out building analysis products more quickly and effectively.

We hope Michal's efforts to establish a vibrant AEC open source software community are recognized by firms such as BuruHappold and are seen to be helpful in keeping client fees where they belong: in the hands of the consultants rather than in the tax havens of the proprietary program vendors.

Branch- and release- driven development

I would really like to move the Spider coding workflow over to a release- and branch-driven very git-oriented workflow. I do, however, have several stumbling blocks I have not figured out how to work-around

* Links to scripts of every release are available
* Clicking any link will run that script in your browser
* No need for git or other tools to be used

In other words the entire history of a project - from R1 to the latest release - is always viewable and runnable by non-technical users and every release is in its own branch.

Using a CDN such as jsDelivr it is easy to link to any asset in any branch or release on GitHub.

What is not so easy is to get a link to the the multiple primary HTML files that can run and load all the relevant scripts and other assets.





Suggestions that could be added to the read me for this repo

***

This repo is a general starting-off space for the Ladybug Tools collaboration. Items may include:

* Sandbox code and comments pre-repo stage - but that would otherwise clutter an existing repo
* Issues and comments that might apply to multiple repos
* Style guides and standards that might apply to multiple projects
* General coding or technical issues not related to specific projects such as
		* Calendars
		* FAQs
		* Utilities

Items for this repo should allow for aging and archiving so as to prevent a clutter of old, no longer used stuff

* Aging and archiving
	* Use year folders for last years things no longer
* Deprecation
	* Links to forks with newer versions

This repo does not replace:

* End user discussion on the Discourse Forum
* Project coding matters in their respective repos
* ladybug-tools.github.io for home page code and assets of wide utility and long duration such as logos and licenses

What is Spider?

Spider is a coding cookbook providing easy-to use and easy-to-customize free open source JavaScript source code.
The over-arching intent is to facilitate the transfer of data between CAD and energy analysis programs via real-time 3D visualization. Tools - mostly built upon the Three.js WebGL library - are available to view, examine and edit data files. Currently the scripts - and accompanying sample file libraries - provide good support for gbXML files and Radiance software data files. Many of the coding samples were written is response to user queries. All code is hosted on GitHub and runnable in the browser by clicking the link in the content management scripts.

links will be added

gbXML Viewer Sun Range Next Generation

'Aragog' gbXML Viewer currently has the ability to depict a Sun range for any date of the year with a maximum of 16 Suns in any rendering.

The current results are moderately acceptable but in no way compare with professional tools such as [Radiance]( https://www.radiance-online.org/). The objective of the current exercise

* Depict the shadows for a gbXML or Radiance .rad files given any reasonable number of Sun positions
* Produce results that are reproducible abd verifiable
* Do all this in a manner that is fast, easy and simple

There are two parts to the solution
* Draw the shadows on the ground
* Draw the shade and shadows on the building

We are currently tackling the first part. Good progress is being made. So here are some first visual results

So Anton sent me this gbXML file which is now online here:

He asked if I could create a Sun Path for this file
Sun Path definition >> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_path
Using Lagybug Toools / Spider / gbXML Viewer. I instantiated the Sun Path menu and from which I created this screen

Just for fun I also called the Sun Shadow Range menu and grabbed this screenshot of the model taken at 12 noon on the shortest day of the year and showing the shadows for ten position of the sun. BTW I noted that the latitude and longitude of the the model is situated in my bedroom in San Francisco.

And, well, it would be nice to be even more technical so here is a screen grab showing the Window Wall Ratios of facades facing the eight canonical solar positions

gbXML Viewer R11 / Launch Video

Hi everybody

Here is an update on the software I have been writing: [gbXML Viewer]( http://www.ladybug.tools/spider/gbxml-viewer/ )

One of my goals in all of this is to help encourage more women and young peeps to be involved with STEM (science, tech, engineering and math ) topics.

It seems that my collaborator, Michal, can deliver the goods: [Ladybug Spider gbXML Viewer Introduction Video](  https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6378839271171772417/ )

Much as I enjoy the watching this video and and listening to its presenter, I wonder if continuing this kind of effort will be a good thing for the people involved and for the product.

You being a seasoned watcher of what peeps watch, I'd really appreciate your take on this effort.

Theo

There's an event called BurningMan https://burningman.org/ now going on in Nevada, USA.

I'm remote hacking with  Temple 2017 http://www.temple2017.org/ and <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma|analemmas> - and adding new features daily.

Animated GIF showing a pile of lumber transformed into a temple or a post-modern architectural deconstruction. It's all here:

http://ladybug.tools/spider/burning-manalemma-2017

Anyway. I'd like to do things like this with the current MicroHouse DXF files.

The issue for me is that these are in the AutoCAD R14 format of DXF. This format is far more complex than previous formats. I should know because I helped write the spec for it what I worked for Autodesk.

Is there any way that the files could be recreated in one of the earlier DXF formats?

Theo


PS There's nothing wrong with the R14 format but it had to handle 3D, PostScript, Paper space and more - thus it is much more of a beast to interpret.
