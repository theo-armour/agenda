[QUOTE]What is the expected server-side performance (e.g., throughput time) for the API service?

Based on the latest instrumentation, the throughput time for our API endpoint is under 500 milliseconds per request at 25% to 75% percentile. While we are proud to provide free API service with no daily/weekly/monthly call limits, we recommend that API call frequency does not extend far beyond ~1 call per second so that we can continue to deliver the optimal server-side performance. If you would like to target a much larger API call volume, please drop us a note at support@alphavantage.co.[/QUOTE]
