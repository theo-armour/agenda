Think of fifteen good interview questions. Let people select and answer ten of them

Try to find things to click on

* Where can we found out about you?
* jsFiddle, CodePen examples?
* Favorite repos? Yours? Others?
* Five predictions
* Can you highlight or describe something you do not agree with
* Mission ~ what are you working on now
* Vision ~ where would you like to be
* Failures? Lessons learned?
* Favorite aspect of JavaScript
* least favorite?

Salut Jérôme

I see that you have accepted ownership of plain-javascript. Yay and thank you!

I have added this file: https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/plain-javascript.github.io/blob/main/brainstorming.md

Following these thoughts, I have forked my links into their own repository: https://github.com/plain-JavaScript/kitchen-sink

I would like to add another repository with your links. If this is OK with you, what would you like the name of the repository to be? Even better: you create the repo and put in whatever you like!

I am  trying to spend an hour a day for the foreseeable future. Of course I have no firm ideas about where it should go or what it should look like. Please do offer ideas and suggestions. Nothing big needed, just an idea or two that I can work on for an hour or so.

Théo
