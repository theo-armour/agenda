Cheese ~ ordered
* Delice de Bourgogne or Brillat Savarin - easy soft cheese crowd pleasers
* Camembert - the character cheese by definition
* Aged Mimolette or Manchego - Easy crowd pleasing hard cheeses. Manchego if all others are cow milk already
* Epoisses - crowd pleaser with character. If not available the Brebirousse d'Argental could be an interesting exploration
* Roquefort or a Tomme de Savoie - both offer different textures and stronger flavors

Charcuteries

* Prosciutto

Extras
