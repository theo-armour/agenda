Being debilitated

* Pain is debilitating
* Work stress is debilitating
* Marital stress is debilitating
* Depression is debilitating

Having all of these is just about insurmountable.

Most people are clueless about what the implications of depression. They think you could bootstrap happiness, if you wanted to.

Depression is like an always-there pain. It confuses, it fogs the brain, it takes you out of being in the moment.

How much of the issue was started in school. At SPS?


Remediation

* Reading about finding happiness is maybe more satisfactory than reading about coping with depression
* Exercise is wonderful. everyday several workout sections at fixed periods during the day.
* Don't break the chain ~ Atomic habits
* Writing, making lists?
* Wondering: knitting or needlepoint? something to do while watching TV? or listening to others on a zoom call

Hi Alex

I do not remember whether the toe fusion procedure is this week or some other time.

In any case, fingers crossed it goes to plan and, heh heh, you are back on your feet soon.

Also, I want to share a thought or two with you:

Generally, for peeps your age, there have not been many "opportunities" to experience the medical system. You are an exception. I think you may agree, it's complex, riddled with issues and quite fascinating. My thought: always be a good patient, listen and take notes. You may be able to help others - children and parents - in the future.

It seems to me that medical personnel can tell you more about the available options after the procedure than they could tell you before the procedure. It something like the options very much depend on your condition after the procedure - which is not known before the procedure. It kind of makes sense. Again, ask questions. Take notes. Share with others.

Fingers crossed - given the shirt duration out-patient procedure - that neither of the above count for much.

And, bravo for organizing a caregiver. It's the sensible thing to do.

Now, back to my colonoscopy prep for my Thursday inspection. ;-)

Cheers,

Theo
