Allison phoned. Getting better. But her bedroom flooded. Pools is a mess

Unhappy with Jonathan and Emma for brining the flu and for discussing her will for an hour when she was sick

Must call her on her mobile from now on.

> Graeber and Wengrow offer a history of the past 30,000 years that is not only wildly different from anything we’re used to, but also far more interesting: textured, surprising, paradoxical, inspiring.

>The authors introduce us to sumptuous Ice Age burials (the beadwork at one site alone is thought to have required 10,000 hours of work), as well as to monumental architectural sites like Göbekli Tepe, in modern Turkey, which dates from about 9000 B.C. (at least 6,000 years before Stonehenge) and features intricate carvings of wild beasts.
