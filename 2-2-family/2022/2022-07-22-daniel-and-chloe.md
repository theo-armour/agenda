# Daniel and Chloe

## TL;DR

I will be delighted to attend your wedding. I won't come to your wedding

## Delights

Saying "yes" to special invites has always brought me delight and fulfillment

In these times of turmoil and peril, the exchange of marital vows is the single event worthy of celebration

Eloise, when asked who would be a person she would like to marry, replied "Daniel"!
