Dr Han

I am your patient. You inspected my eyes for glaucoma on October 7.

This message, however, is about another patient, Diana Chase of 1175 California St SF, my first cousin and good friend.

Diana was re-scheduled for outpatient ocular surgery at 1600 Divisadero on 13 November. She had previously been scheduled for January at Mt Parnassus with a two day stay.

Due to her head going through a car windshield in her youth, Diana has a number of memory and processing issues. For example, she has issues with forgetting to take medications as well as forgetting that she has just taken medications. Given the state of her glaucoma she has a significant fall risk. She lives by herself. Her personal assistant is in Europe until the weekend.

In my opinion, UCSF proceeding with an outpatient ocular procedure with the current lack of safeguards will put my cousin in a very risky situation.

Please feel free to contact me at 415-828-0000.
