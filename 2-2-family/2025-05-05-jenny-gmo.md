Any actual connection between AI, regulations, public safety and what actually happens on the shelf in the grocery store is tenuous at best. The only thing that is certain is that the FDA and USDA let alone https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/ are not going to be able to keep up with the pace of change in AI.

>In your perspective, how hard would it be to build an app to run a scan to determine if a product, content, etc. is AI generated?
>I would imagine such a certification would also need a stamp/image that's clickable to prove authenticity. Not sure how hard this is to do.

Not easy

* Any photo you take of anything is already processed in many ways.
* Any barcode thingy, even if un-hackable might actually be pointing to a counterfeit product. (the map is not the territory)
* And more...

Not to worry though!

Carter will invent a ray gun that you zap at the food and it will instantly tell you about the food's history, including if it was AI generated or not. It will also tell you if the food is safe to eat, and if it is not, it will zap it into a pile of goo. The goo can then be used to power your car or something.
