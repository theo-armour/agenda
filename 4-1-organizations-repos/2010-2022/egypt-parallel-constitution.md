What is a right? Many ways of defining, cataloging and assigning. Too many ways for just a few people to tackle.

But

Zuckerberg connects two billion people and started this in his dormitory room

Macron - never elected to office - starts a political pary and sweeps into the presidents office on 15 months

Wikipedia had 65 people until recently

The issue with writing a constitution has much to do with nuanced categorization of rights.

There could be millions of permutations.

But what if we looked at things the other way around?

Suppose we created a catalog, a list of all things that have been declared as rights in all constitutions since the beginning of civilization.
of civilization?

Say there are a thousand documents available and, say, each has 250 rights or privileges each.

Probably, ten percent of the items could be discarded as being no longer relevant.
Of the remaining part probably 80 percent of more would be near duplicates.
My guess is that looking through all these documents, it's unlikely that there much more than ten thousand types of rights.
In other words all the rights that have ever been declared could fit in a single spreadsheet.
Of the 10K rights there may be a couple of hundred rights that have 80% of the appearances.
And they could probably be printed in ten to twenty pages

The issue is how to catalog the rights - or more specifically - how to categorize or tags the rights.

Points of view such as libertarian, socialist, Sharia, Hasidic, Buddhist-influenced
may all be established by moving rights into 'may', 'may not' and 'not applicable'
