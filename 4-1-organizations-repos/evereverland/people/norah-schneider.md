Hello Norah

Thank you for the update and I hope this message finds you well.

Wow! This seems like a much better placement for your brain than the library (though libraries are great as well).  Your ability to seriously double-click into a topic - as you did with the Chicago newspaper (what was its name??) in your dissertation - should serve you well when there are clients that respect and honor your extra diligence.

### Phase 1 - Vital Facts - Sources
The above is the name of the folder that contains the particulars of my family that you sourced.
I heart reviewing the sources of my family particulars that you located. They help make my peeps come back to life. Nonetheless, it seems to me that there are so many more complex and challenging tasks that you could be tackling - and that only a person with your depth of experience could prevail. Here is a personal anecdotal example: I met a person with the family name of Haskell - same as my great-grandmother. Well, making all the connections using Geni/MyHeritage etc, my friend Gardner Haskell is either my fifth cousin or may eighth cousin. I spent hours on this - on site with good links to sources - and yet never go to the bottom.

So: I would be delighted to - one day - discuss with you how we can bring to together your meticulous, traditional genealogical expertise with the fast-paces, error-prone but huge and all-encompassing data that is available online these days. I can envisage some kind of genealogical cabal that melds tradition genealogy with the digital - and with things like gedcom so as to get the data into online worlds and accessed by AI. I hope we can discuss ideas like this in detail one day.

### Genealogy Presentations of the Future

In our lengthy phone conversation, you mentioned that you were in communication with people that were envisaging the future of the study of genealogy. Do you know of a forum or mailing list where these things are discussed?
