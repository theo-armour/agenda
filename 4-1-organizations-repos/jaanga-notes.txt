# Jaanga Notes

No side menus
Navigate back up with bread crumbs

All repos and folders to have readme.md and index.html with readme reader

Issue:
file names get changed causing broken links.
The broken links are usually in higher level folders - because they are not apparent

Resolution:
Links in higher level folders - as much as possible - should point to other readme files
Only the local readme file should link to actual files
