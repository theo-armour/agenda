A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum

Actually, I broke my hip on Guy Fawkes day - and  had surgery to pin the break on the same day. I'm on the mend and as enthusiastic as ever, but recovey will take time. Currently, I have to use a walker even for a few steps. (But they will take the keyboard out of my cold dead fingers ;-)

Of course, EverEverLand fell by the wayside, but not completely.

In future messages, I will bring up Meg Kensington, Neil Higgins and Simone Alexander as sidekicks.

As you may remember, in October I was investigating Effective Altruism (EA), Longtermism, Will McAskill etc. All of this in the interest of helping determine some of the "whys" of EverEvrLand (EEL). Well, in the past month, EA has been very in the news because Sam Bankman-Fried is/was a major EA benefactor and his FTX organization has entered bankruptcy because of BitCoin issues. Closr to home, EA is hugely complex and finding a meshing of thought between EA and EEL will take much time and effort. Part of this is because the current EA documentation - which is massive - makes little reference to history, the arts and beauty - all of which are emblematic for EEL. Furthermore, EA does nt appear to cover the other aspect of EEL that I consider crucial - which is how EEL organizes itslf in some collaborative and non-hierarchical yet self-sustaining way.

On this last front, something delightful seems to have dropped into my lap: _Dawn of Everything - A New History of Humanity_. See below.

Have you hear of this book? Have you read it or heard about? In any case I look forward to talking to yu about it and investigating ways in which this effort could inform EEL.

I hope you are well, preparing to roast the bird or whatever, and meeting up with good people

A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation.

For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.

Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume.

The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.
