# 2021-06-24 Maya Agenda


## Running meetings
I like the idea of how Amazon runs meetings:

In our case we can "Start with silence" - just read these notes and look at the links first and then chat.


## Current hypothesis
Do these statements make sense to you as an overview for the next few weeks?
* We are practicing working together.
* We want to see is there are efforts that are mutually beneficial


## What Tools do we want to use in order to keep track of things?
Google Docs? DropBox, Evernote?

GitHub?

What tools do you like to work with?


## How to keep track of time and charges?
* Time sheet? Spreadsheet?

share google folder


## Project Job description
This is getting to be a rather large and cumbersome affair. I am thinking we might start off by writing a job description for just one of the tasks. Perhaps  genealogy might be good for a first pass

How about concentrating on the Genealogy Project as an example project?

One of the things I would like to see is that whoever manages a person actually has some experience with the task that is being managed. In this case, would you like to have a go at learning something about www.geni.com? For example, would you like to trace your Hovey lineage? Geni makes it easy to find the lineages of people with the same family name


## What to do next?
I think I need to work on the Project Description. What do you think?
