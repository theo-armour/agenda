# 2021-05-22 Agenda Maya Theo

The project of writing a job description, is the first step in an ongoing project likely to have numerous stages and phases.

In today's meeting there are the following three items that may be discussed. Following them are a number of background points.


## 1. Project Description

Wanted

* Getting to "Yes, I have a picture"
* First Rule of Improv: "say yes!" ~ I hear what you are saying and where you are coming from
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking ~ total empathy in the beginning. Never say "No"

Actions

* Tasks at hand: dealing with "It's complicated"
* Theo to continue to refine and add to the Google D0ocs currently in progress
* Maya: Point out the gaps in thinking and items that need clarification

Notes

* Theo: When I am in "design mode", I am very sensitive to push backs on my thoughts. Having to defend an idea while it is in the process of being born often becomes too tricky for my brain. Just saying


## 2. Job Description

Wanted

* A well defined "contract" or job description
* The way Theo and Maya collaborate now sets the stage for ongoing work

Actions

* Identify most of the roles that will be needed
* Identify how to delegate, manage, document and report on the roles played

Payments

* $30 per hour to start
* $35 and $40 when agreed targets are met
* $50+ or % when we are in the money (to be defined)
* Bonuses when indicators for projects are met
* Time and cost of transport included
* Meetups at meals: ?? charges

Actions

* When items 1. and 2. are at a "good enough" state much of what item 2. needs could mostly fall into place.


## 3. Vision

Wanted

* Ways of finding meaning and value in this collaboration that go beyond the exchange of time and money
* Open source wherever possible

Actions

* Identify collaborative practices of interest
* To be discussed

Notes

* Noam Chomsky possible first source of ideas for where to look??
* Socialist thinking not so helpful because mostly references large numbers of workers
* Libertarians not so helpful because mostly individuals versus government

***

## Targets

* If we meet, say, once a week and update files in between that a ready-to-go document might be ready after the third meeting


## Indicator

* A request for proposal with job project descriptions and is published or sent out for proposals
