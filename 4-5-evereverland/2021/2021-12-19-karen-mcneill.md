Dear Karen

I hope this email finds you well.

I look forward to meeting you when your visit to the Heritage on the Marina is rescheduled.

In the meantime, would you kindly help me find a person or persons that has a breadth of vision relating to becoming good a ancestor that is as broad and comprehensive as your vision?

I have the ancestors, the museum quality possessions and thousands of documents. I am prepared to budget several thousand dollars a month for as long as it takes.

If you are interested in making an introduction, I will be pleased to prepare a one-pager that outlines the goods.
