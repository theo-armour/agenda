our product has to be attractive to managers not just workers 

and the samples page could actually be advertising showing named samples from different organizations

in other words there could be a section for BuroHappold files, ASHRAE files etc

in other words the files become things from sponsors who pay money to have their files included in our product

and, as I said, different versions

Spider gbXML Viewer (SGV) build, SGV for OpenStudio, SGV for gbXML.org, etc are customized for their particular audiences
