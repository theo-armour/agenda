# Advice wanted: Spider gbXML viewer for Open studio

The [National renewable Energy Laboratory]( https://nrel,gov) is asking for an update to the version of the Spider gbXML Viewer to be embedded in their upcoming release of [OpenStudio]( https://www.openstudio.net/ ) 2.9.0.What should be inthe update to help your workflow?



The development of the beta version is well underway. We hope that you will look at the beta and advise us as to what should be added or what should be taken away to fulfill the mission.

Here is a screenshot showing the new version but running in OpenStdio 2.8.0. 

You may try things out yourself by copying this file [Spider gbXML Viewer for OpenStudio 2.9.0]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-viewers-for-openstudio/spider-gbxml-viewer-for-openstudio-2-9-0/v-0-06-00/embeddable_gbxml_editor.html ) into the "bin" folder of the OpenStudio program. Then run the app by following the instructions in OpenStudio documentation here: [Working with gbXML]( http://nrel.github.io/OpenStudio-user-documentation/tutorials/tutorial_gbxmlimport/ ).

Even simpler: you can also view and run the beta version in your browser by clicking on this link:

The full version of the Spider gbXML Viewer - with many bells and whstles - is available here:

BTW, the Viewer for Open Studio has a tough - and limited - mission:

* Run in very old browsers and old hardware
* Deploy into complicated and secure large organization environments
* Deploy using almost any devops framework
* Be instantly useful to any user
* Provide immrdiately useful insights into the model in view

Can you help us get there?
