Looked into San Francisco demographics. Approximately 4000 graduate from high school every year. Over so many years, plus, that would mean about 300,000 people here went to high school here. 33% of the population was born outside of the country. The people that call themselves San Francisco natives. Are very much in minority.

So who owns a city? just because you are born here? Does that mean you own the city? Perhaps that's true for many cities. But does it have to be true for all cities? Can San Francisco be an exception? If a majority of the people are not native, then maybe are not. Their needs may be more important.
