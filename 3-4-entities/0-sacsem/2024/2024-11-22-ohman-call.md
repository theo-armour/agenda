Salutations Sacramento Seminarians

Mike Fitzgerald sends you a heads-up: Our Friday speaker "Jack Ohman is a big deal."

He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle. He's a syndicated cartoonist. His work appears in over 200 newspapers. He's a regular contributor to the New York Times, and his cartoons have been featured on CNN, 60 Minutes, and the Colbert Report. He's also a regular guest on NPR's "Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me." He's a big deal.

Today's cartoon is a good example of his work. It's a commentary on future elections. It's a good example of how he uses humor to make a point. He's a big deal.
