Tech-enhanced Life and a virtual community of older adults (the Longevity Explorers) are exploring the future of aging. We are especially interested in how new products and services that leverage technology can improve quality of life as we age.

Using the search for tags feature, many more will be found.

With a bit of sleuth work, it would be possible to contact these writers with the objective of eventually joining forces.

The next steps

* Complete the search and triage down to a shortlist of subdomains with similar interests
* Add their to domains to the list of recommendations
* Contact the writers and ask them to join forces
