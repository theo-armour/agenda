## Nine Perfect Strangers

* March 24
* Liane Moriarty

* https://www.amazon.com/Nine-Perfect-Strangers-Liane-Moriarty-ebook/dp/B07C75GRLY
	* An Amazon Best Book of November 2018: Liane Moriarty is back with another delicious page-turner, but this time her characters don't discover their lives unexpectedly transformed by a surprising event—they deliberately buy into a ten-day spa package with the hope that they will emerge different, happier people. A few days of silence, lots of yoga and mindfulness, and absolutely no alcohol seem to be working wonders, at least for middle-aged novelist Frances Welty, who is recovering from an online swindle and a career crash. The other eight participants have astonishingly similar positive reactions to their regimen at Tranquillum House…at least until they discover why. Moriarty is at her best when she's diving impetuously into her characters' heads, exposing with affection their rushes to judgment, their contradictions, and their moments of grace and generosity. The "aha" moment that has won Moriarty so many fans with Big Little Lies and Truly Madly Guilty never quite materializes, and some readers might roll their eyes at the multitude of chapters at the end that attempt to tie everything up nicely. But in the end, it's an optimistic novel, showcasing how our shared flawed humanity is also our greatest strength in the face of duress, as long as we can create common ground. —Adrian Liang, Amazon Book Review

### Firoozeh

* born 1965
* UCB
* book 2003 - age 38



### Comments

* It's not a book I would pickup to read myself
* I almost want to read another of her books to see if it's just as bad
* The flow, the grammar, the level of writing all very acceptable
* The level of word play is quite high - A Nose by Any Other Name - Girls Just Wanna Have Funds
* Many questions about POV
	* Writing about her childhood through the eyes of her adult self
	* Vivid memories about what people said and did - unlikely to occur to a seven year ols

## Central character

* It's a book about her father
* Traces Faroozeh's family life from her primary school through college/marriage
* 25 or 5 page chapters
* screenplays for a half-hour sitcom
* There is nor over-arching message or theme


## Depictions

* Shows little mercy for her father Kazem- treats him like an _idiot savant_
	* She narrates that he loves her, but not thatshe loves him
* Displays even less for her mother Nazireh - treats her like an idiot
* Uncle Nematollah: kind of a jerk
* Al: hated
* Aunt Seg..., brothers, husband, second grade teacher: all OK
* Peeps are either stupid or every smart
* Gives few indications regarding the sources of her own personal culture, humor and literary talents
* We do not see how she judges herself

## Comparables

* Beverley Hillbillies - The whole notion on which The Beverly Hillbillies is founded is an encouragement to ignorance
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllis_Diller
	* Onstage, she called her husband Fang. Diller told Fang jokes like her male counterparts told wife jokes
