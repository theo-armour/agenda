### WSD Weekly Team Meeting

Hi Noah

My inability to attend the postponed WSD weekly team meeting this morning due to a conflict was a disappointment.

Nonetheless, I have comments regarding the WSD Weekly Department Review spreadsheet you shared.

The  WSD Weekly Department Review is a very impressive document. It is detailed and thorough but not overwhelming. It is very clear and easy to follow. I am particularly impressed by the level of collaboration and participation it represents.

I am also happy to see good numbers on the sales worksheet.

Bravo!

Theo

Hi Noah

Thank you for inviting me to today's WSD team meeting this morning.

Here are some of the comments I wrote down as I listened:

Very business-like ~ things seem normal ~ clearing up Alex's email threads progressing ~ very collaborative ~ inquisitive ~ exploratory ~ deep listening ~ Paul: looking at the whole process ~ enthusiasm ~ Joe: following leads, looking for new clients

It was a very "alive" meeting, with everybody fully participating. The accompanying spreadsheet was very detailed and clear.

Steer the course!

Theo

Noah
* Look for back up hard drives ~ either at home or in office
* They may no be password protected
* Copy data to cloud
* Be ready so that can jump when passwords arrive

Look at monthly income from top twenty accounts
* Use billing system to ascertain what work was done for each of those account
* Look for the "I have no clue what that was for" amounts
* If the amount is small, ignore it for now
* If the amount is large, ask the client what it was for
* use time sheets to help
* Use dates and Alex's emails to help


* Alex lunch?
* No Instagram posts since February but innocuous blog post April 25

Hi WSD support

The WSD is really beginning to come together. Bravo!

I note that the W3C validator finds issues:

https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.websightdesign.com%2F

Also, when you open the developer console after loading the home page there are som jQuery issues etc.

Also:
The DIV I am writing this in should be resizable

I see  a message every time I hint enter: "onloadwff.js:71 Assertion failed: Input argument is not an HTMLInputElement"

Tech

* Visited Intranet. thank you for link. Submitted comments using online form.

* Whats is tricky about Ubuntu 14 upgrade? What are somed of the lessons learned so that the upgrade to U21 is easier?

* OMG: Harvest time tracking!


Home Page

* Begenning to look good
* Signed up for Updates
* Search results page has issues, ditto testimonials
* No email address on contact us page, no link to Google Maps, text box should be resizable
* Not clear "Connect with Us" is Instagram feed


Intranet

* Initial load time is reasonable, responses to clicks are quick
* UI and UE feel good
* Looked at all pages. There were no fails, times were good, no immediately apparent issues
* I had a brief look at the source code. One day it will likely be minified, but in there meantime, I heart its readability.

I can provide a number of observations regarding the use experience, but I do understand that the site is still under development. Therefore my commenting now would be a distraction.

I will be checking on progress from time to time. Should I continue to use this form to add comments?
