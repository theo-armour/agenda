# 2024-07-26 Claire X Influencers

Hi Claire

Change of methodology: Use AI to seek out top influencers in the AI, crypto, and Web3 spaces.

Results in a spreadsheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x1GHVhsnHaSa0oWOfXqPlHQTQiCXhi3hWiKMbgQX-uY/edit?usp=sharing

To gather the data I used the following following prompt on chatGPT 40 where XXXXX was "web3", "time saving AI", and "crypto":

Create a list of the 50 top current influencers on X.com for XXXXX.

The output must be in CSV format with the following items:

"Influencer name", "@ handle","following","followers","website","bio"

Some observations:

* The followers and following counts are indicative but mostly hallucinatory
* Most of results are big players and very generic and may not be useful to Sensay
* Methodology is not perfect but it's a start
* We need more detailed criteria to refine the search

We could go through each of these influencers and see if they are relevant to Sensay. But I would like to continue to explore and refine the search parameters. Maybe are you looking for influencers who like making lists or cataloging things? And wanting to encourage them to add Sensay to their lists?

Anyway, I'm here to help you refine the search. Let me know what you think!
