Hi Timothey

We talked briefly yesterday at the SH Heritage/ California Wine event. Nonetheless, it chat rang a lot of bells.

long message below. Reply if it raises interesting thoughts. And/or if you any senior legacy programs of interest.

Wrangling High Schools

Given your interest in wrangling high school students into the orbit of family history, it would be cool for students to research the trees of the elders and "founding parents" in the towns they live in.

Or, given the retirement community I live in, there would be residents interested in learning their trees but would be clueless in clicking the right buttons.
