Hello Karen and Dan,

## Introduction + Game Plan??

I've wanted to introduce the two of you for quite a while, but it's taken me some time to figure out what it's all about.

Below is a long email. Read it when you have the time. At the same time, it's all a top-level overview. For each of the ideas, I can supply deeper background and possible next steps. Or make outlandish requests. This text is just to see if there's initial interest from you for me to start double-clicking a bit further.

Cheers,

Theo

## Replica Wranglers

First, I want to talk about what this topic is not about. Dan recently sent me this link, which has not been working for me today:

[Forget Me Not](https://www.figma.com/proto/aDkTdDASdKGEczoDolneot/Website-%7C-Forget-Me-Not?page-id=2065%3A2958&node-id=2071-2409&viewport=541%2C369%2C0.06&t=PyhBPFEE56KHxrR6-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2065%3A2960)

If I remember correctly, the link takes you to a website that helps people create a chatbot or digital replica of an elderly person. There are two aspects to this.

The first is that there is already a large, established market of very similar products. Relevant searches:

* https://www.google.com/search?q=legacy+chatbots
* https://www.google.com/search?q=Tribute+Video+Creators
* https://www.google.com/search?q=legacy+videos

Few people need better buggy whips.

Second, my experience living with many older people (people in their eighties and beyond) is that getting almost all but a few elderly people to do anything other than read books, watch TV, or eat is very, very difficult. Another way of putting it is that people become content consumers; their ability to create content, even to write an email of any length, is almost nonexistent.

Thus, it appears that any entry into a market like this would require a very large promotion budget to break into an established market with many players, and would need extensive testing and development while building a product around a challenging demographic.

The reason I am writing this document is because I believe there might be other digital tribute and legacy avenues to explore—markets that are easier to enter, have lower development costs, and create new types of job descriptions for humans.

## Family Offices

The first idea that comes to mind is people who can help build legacy products around family offices.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_office

This market has the intergenerational conscience as well as sufficient wealth and leisure to begin considering multi-generational replica projects.

## Biographers

The biographies and autobiographies of the future are not likely to be paper-based.

People who want to write their autobiography are often wealthy and committed to investing time. Ghostwriters who assist them could create digital replicas of a person at various stages and locations in life. This opens up ideas for new industries, with replicas acting out scenarios in game development environments.

Biographers who build digital replicas of historical figures could also do the same.

They will need available methods and tools to make this happen.

## Replica Creators / Replicators

If there's anything we need in this new world of AI, it's new job descriptions for humans. And I am ground zero for needing the type of person I will describe. I have:

* Dozens of bank boxes crammed with documents going back five generations
* Dozens of photo and slide albums
* Dozens of paintings—some of which should be in museums
* Dozens of websites with gigabytes of personal, family, and friend-created content
* Dozens of boxes of artifacts, mementos, and treasures

IMHO, it's more than enough material and data to create a dozen replicas.

The issue is that for something like a dozen years, I've been looking for somebody to manage the process of digitizing and finding new homes for this repository of material. I can easily locate somebody to restore the paintings or physically scan paper pages.

What I have found impossible to locate is a person who could manage the entire process—a person who can gather and wrangle a bunch of talents and get the job done. A person who can describe a vision of what might happen to the whole collection.

Of course, that person could be me, but I'm already in the middle of a very complex life. More to the point, dealing with one's personal possessions is like going down a rabbit hole of memories that you can't get out of. It's doomscrolling before there was doomscrolling.

My guess is that I am not alone. There are plenty of people out there who have accomplished much and are happy to share their accomplishments. And in their attics, garages, storage lockers, and in the cloud is the knowledge to be shared. And many of them, like myself, have the money but nobody to send it to.

Digital shepherds, where are you? Your flocks await you. Dozens of them.
