Good morning, Theo, and hello, Dan! It's good to meet you virtually. Theo mentioned you to me a little while back, and your story looks very interesting.

A conversation feels a little bit more appropriate to your email, Theo, than correspondence, but I'll offer my initial thoughts.

The very first thing to me is to understand Dan's replica vision. I did check out the website, but in the personal, family, and business history and legacy context, I'm not quite sure how it all works.

Replica Wranglers -- 100% agreement. I was first approached about this concept before the pandemic, so at least six years ago. It's already a saturated space.

Family Offices -- This is the space I've been working in for the past 12+ years. This is certainly the demographic group that has the money, and this industry is kind of changing dramatically. I say "kind of" because the rhetoric is changing faster than the industry. For the most part, family offices and multi-family offices are still investment shops first and then tax/estate/financial planning entities. Rhetoric has been on the rise for a holistic approach to family wealth management for a couple of decades, meaning a growing focus on preparing heirs and fostering a flourishing family culture. Governance, financial education, leadership development, strengths building, conversations and exercises around shared mission, vision, values, and legacy, all play into this, and this is where history and storytelling come into play too. Like I said, this is a growing space filled with potential, but convincing family offices to spend money on long-term soft investments -- assuming you can get past the gatekeeper -- can be a challenge.

Biographers -- I don't quite agree that the future of biographies is not paper. I think they'll be multi-media products with interactive components. Books are still the most stable technology of the legacy products world. As I mentioned, though, I've been involved in everything from conversations to proofs of concepts for the talking ghost mentioned above, digital living archives and story building platforms, augmented reality experiences, holograms, bespoke LLMs, and combinations of all of the above. The hero's story is one area of focus, especially for public consumption, but, related to the family office opportunity, developing something that captures multiple people in the family narrative will be important. The hero's tale is often alienating.

Replica Creators/Replicators -- Well, that feels like a conversation to be had. Most of what you describe sounds like a lot of what I do, but the end product -- the replica -- may put a spin on things that I don't quite understand. As I said, I feel like I really need to know more about Dan's world to wrap my head around all of this.

So, those are my first thoughts.

What are you thinking, Dan?

Cheers,
Karen
