Hello Tyler

We talked briefly at the SH Heritage/California Wine event on Thursday. Nonetheless, our chat rang a lot of bells.

Long message below. Reply if it raises thoughts of interest. And/or if you are pursuing any senior legacy programs of interest.

Cheers,

Theo

## High Schools Wranglers

Given your interest in wrangling high school students into the orbit of family history, it would be cool for students to research the trees of the elders and "founding parents" in the towns they live in.

Or, given the retirement community I live in, there would be residents interested in learning their trees but would be clueless in clicking the right buttons.

If you have or are developing any programs in this area, I'm all ears.

## Senior Shepherds

I a "youngster" - 78 - living in a retirement community of people with an average of 90+. I moved in early because I'm disabled.

I'm quite sure there are a number of us that would like to know more details about their family. Learning about this is almost impossible for an audience like ours. If somebody with Ancestry knowledge could come in and give us a lecture about how to do this, it would be helpful. Even more helpful if someone would actually become a Ancestry consultant for seniors living here.

Virtually every upper end retirement community in America has activity programs that include lectures and workshops. In the five hears I've been at Heritage, there has not been any activity relate to ancestry and genealogy.

Looking at the Ancestry website, It looks this kind of activity would be ideal for the progenealogists at Ancestry.
