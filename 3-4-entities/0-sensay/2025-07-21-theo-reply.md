## Looking for Wise Heroes

Hi Karen and Dan,

Thank you both for your engaged and thoughtful replies. You both bring up excellent points.

Karen, my favorite snippet is "The hero's story is one area of focus". Dan, yours is "Whereas we focus on the wisdom, personality, and style"

Putting these together, it becomes a search for the "wise heroes" of our time. I think this is a great place to start.

Before Double-clicking into "Wise Heroes". Let me just update a few things I've seen recently.

## AI Griefbots

Good Grief! The industry even has a name now, AI Griefbots. This marketplace for nearly dead and dead people is saturated with low-grade players.

Nonetheless, this indicates that there is a lot of general public interest and people spending money for these services.

## Ancestry

People are willing to pay significant amounts pf cash, $5K and more for ancestry services. Interestingly, services like these can be provided at much lower prices from competitors such a [geni.com](https://www.geni.com/)

In any case, AI will kill these people
