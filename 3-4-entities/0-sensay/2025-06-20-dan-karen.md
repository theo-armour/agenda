## Draft Message

Hi Karen and Dan

You both may have seen this article about digital replicas in the NY Times

Never Say Goodbye

That is not what this introduction is about.

It's much more about Karen's vision:

I'm a family historian for the ultra-wealthy. I've uncovered stories about Prohibition bootleggers and Alaskan explorers â€” here's what my job is like.

https://www.businessinsider.com/family-historian-ultra-wealthy-us-bank-what-job-like-2021-10

The focus is on people who might normally write an autobiography or work closely with a ghostwriter

Or somebody like me who is a digital hoarder, or who has an extensive Facebook or Instagram portfolio.

Thinking out loud: It might be about an antique car dealer who kep a record of every car they had sold or a decorator who kept images of every project.

And it could be about a person uploaded every video to YouTube

In other words it about people who have accumulated a treasure trove of personal information of some sort. It might be already digital or at least it could be digitized somehow. The person or people involved may be older but they are not yet nearing death. They are at least moderately available o discuss what is being digitized,

## Likely prospects #1

* Wealthy business person who has something to say and a ton of financial narratives
* A college professor with many published articles
* A religious practitioner with published homilies
* Anybody with extensive Facebook, Instagram, X posts
* Anybody who has access to all their historical emails or documents

## Possible Values

* Replica has a mission, vision and values
* The replica is serving a purpose, being useful
* It's more about ethics and values than accomplishments and acquisitions
* It's about good and normal people

## Generative Genealogy

* The past is as difficult to predict as the future.
* Creating likely pasts
* Narrators or "Godparents" that are amalgams of known people, who "know" all the members of the family
* Personalities from youth to aged
* Google Street view
* Recreations of known events, every reminiscing can be recreated

## Prospects #2

* Family name associations
* Extended families
* Tribes or clans
* Groups with blood lineage or other traceable and linked connections
