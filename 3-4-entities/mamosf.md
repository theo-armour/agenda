Great attention from the staff. Interesting and very tasty Colombian and Venezuelan dishes. Some nice wines.

Update 02-13-2024

This is an update to one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I've been coming here since 2020.

Michael the proprietor has recently updated the menu. My favorite first course is the Patacones - fried green plantains with Mamo's sauce - and the Tequeños - a Venezuelan dish with fried breaded cheese. Then it gets difficult. For a main course, I could do the Arroz con Pollo, the Steak Chimichurri or the Arepas. And for your friends who are not so adventurous the MaMo's Burger still has an excellent South American flavor.

On the drinks side, I usually go for a draft beer, or a rosé or malbec. For a closer I'll take a shot of their tequila soju. But tonight, I am trying something new: fresh passion fruit with a shout of rum soju.

For dessert, I quite like one of the appetizers: Maduros - fried sweet plantains.

Of course, I am writing this update here at MaMo. I may not be in Colombia, but I like what it feels like being here.

Of course, I am writing this update sitting at a table by the front door here at MaMo. I may not be in Colombia, but I like what it feels like being here.
