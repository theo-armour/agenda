AI note-takers are flooding Zoom calls as workers opt to skip meetings.

***

I have been a content creator in a corporate world. I include designing buildings and software as content creation. Creating content is all about establishing long lasting. Simply put: content is about bricks, word, code and durable things

Meetings are all about words that just disappear into the air. Words are essential if you're making a sales pitch or coaching a team, but not so helpful if you are building something extremely complex. Numerous meetings I endured, very often served to slow rather than tweak progress. These days I try both attend in person and use the note takers to help me remember what, if anything, might have been agreed.

The note takers help me concentrate on the nuances of the speaker and not having to worry about spelling mistakes

I happen to be using a Plaud device as the note-taking app these days. Zoom, Otter, etc: they all seem to complexify more than simplify, but the added value still feels like its worth it. And who knows what meetings will be like five years from now>

Frank's repost has a very readable summery of the improvements, but I'm not sure about the predictions.

I like Satya's observation:

>Nadella posted, “Jevons paradox strikes again! As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of.”

>**What is theJevons Paradox?**
>TheJevons paradox, as described by Nadella, is the idea that technological progress that makes a resource cheaper or more efficient to use often leads to an increase in demand for that resource.

My favorite summary so far:

Very long read.

Total cost of DeepSeek's LLM is probably closer to $100. And mare additional nuance to consider.

For me, the main takeaway:

This is a tactical victory for open source
