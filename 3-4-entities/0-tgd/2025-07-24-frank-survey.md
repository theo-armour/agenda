I ask the Perplexity Comment Browser to comment on the app. Here are its notes.

Intended Use:

The survey is likely used to collect human evaluations of music/audio generated by AI, measuring both technical quality and alignment with written prompts.

I asked Perplexity Comet for a prompt to rebuild the app and then asked it to generate the app, which it did. Here's the link.

Some comments

* I was hoping for something more wonderful and modern than just a regular Survey Monkey survey.
* It took only a couple of minutes to generate the prompt and the demo app using Perplexity Comet.
* It took quite a bit longer than 10 minutes to complete the survey.
* I would like to see the intended purpose of the survey. I like to know what I'm being a guinea pig for.
* I would like to see some of the results of the survey. How do I compare with others?
* Getting the sound bites to repeat was a bit tricky.
* 80s inspired nostalgic vibe with consistent mood with arpeggio bass and powerful drums. I recorded a 80s juno analog synth to create intrigue and slowly and progressively opened the filter to create a build leading to the chorus
* I had fun pasting your prompts into Suno and getting many interesting variations
* The future of music is very scary
* You are double-clicking into deep human nature. Art instrumentation, and money-making all up for grabs
* I look forward to learning about your next steps
* Keep going!!!!
