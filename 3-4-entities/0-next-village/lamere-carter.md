Hi La'mère

Sorry for my slow reply. The last few days of every month I go nuts working on the newsletter for residents. And the it takes a few days to recover.

So when our we going to introduce our drones to each other?

This week is a bit busy, but starting on Saturday the next is open. I'm looking forward to catching up.

Formal

Lamere Carter joined me for a delightful breakfast, arriving punctually. We had a fascinating conversation. He is very health-conscious and follows the Atkins diet, indicating his interest in technical literature. Fit and hailing from Sacramento, his educational background remains unknown to me. However, our primary connection was his passion for flying drones, which he has used professionally. Notably, he assisted PGE in inspecting power lines in California, identifying those needing maintenance or tree trimming.

Lamere resides on Bay Street near Fisherman's Wharf and the Embarcadero, having lived there for three months. This was his second Next Village Encounter. Our discussion covered various topics, including what makes San Francisco special. I have long considered it a technology hub since 1849, with its plethora of bars and restaurants drawing people in. Today, I realized that San Francisco's uniqueness in the 1800s stemmed from a surplus of capital generated by gold mining, forestry, and other natural resources. This excess capital enabled the founding of new companies, a trend that persists today with bankers and venture capitalists continually raising funds for startups.

We also discussed the dynamic between transplants and locals in San Francisco. Transplants bring technology and new ideas, while locals manage essential services like restaurants, hospitals, and more. This symbiotic relationship fosters the city's modern vibrancy despite occasional communication gaps.

Lamere has a Christian background and shares a gentle worldview similar to many Uber drivers and people of color I've met. Though he used to drink, he no longer does. Perhaps we might visit the Interval for ginger tea sometime.

Additionally, Lamere is deeply involved in cybersecurity and has passed several relevant licenses. We both expressed concerns about AI and social media's impact on isolating individuals through doom scrolling. Our conversation led us to consider using AI positively to foster social engagement and better activities for young people. We coined the term cyber inspiration as an antidote to cybersecurity fears and might share this idea online.

Lastly, I showed him how to use accented letters on an Android phone to correctly spell his name—L-A apostrophe M-E-R-E.

There is much more to discuss about Lamere Carter, but this will suffice for now. I look forward to seeing him again for a drone race or another tech-related activity. Until next time!

Lamere Carter, lovely breakfast, he came on time and we had a great talk. He is very conscious about health and he's an Atkins diet protein eater, obviously reads technical literature. He's also fit, from Sacramento, don't know what his background is in terms of education, but the main thing, and he's been working with contractors and things like that, but the main thing, our main connection was that he loves flying drones and he's used drones for work. He helped PGE inspect power lines in California, looking for power lines that need help and fixing and cutting tree branches and falling down. He lives on Bay Street near Fisherman's Wharf and the Embarcadero. He's been here three months. This is his second Next Village Encounter.

We talked about a number of topics. Why is San Francisco special? We added to my thinking that one of the reasons, I've talked about being a technology center since 1849 and also about having all the bars and restaurants, inviting people. The realization that I came to today was that what was interesting about San Francisco in the 1800s was that there was a surplus of capital, that the gold and the mining and the forestry and all these other natural resources were enabling extra money that could be used to start new companies. This has continued ever since, it seems to me, that once this started, the bankers and venture capital, they've always been able to raise money and find people interested in starting new companies. That's the reason why San Francisco remains special, remains and it continues to be special now as we move into the future because of being a startup for venture capital many years ago.

There was another realization and that we were talking about people coming in and he called them transplants. I think we recognize the difference between the transplants and the locals. The transplants have done the technology and all the new ideas and things like that, but the point of the locals is that they've been running the restaurants and the service industries and the hospitals and all the other things that transplants needed. There's been a symbiotic relationship between the locals and the transplants. They don't necessarily communicate terribly well as I could see from Sacramento Seminar, but they are in a likened relationship between algae and bacteria or whatever the symbiotic relationship is. They both need each other and together they fostered this amazing modern Athens, change the world kind of a place that neither necessarily understand about the other.

We let's see, he has a Christian background and like so many people that I've been meeting that are Uber drivers or people of color, there is a devout background. Not what we hear about, but a very gentle way of thinking about things. He's very consumerist food and he used to be a drinker, but he's no longer a drinker. That could be interesting. We could might do something like go down to the interval, but have a ginger tea. He's been involved with, oh yes
I remember the other aspect that we were interested in. He's been very involved with cybersecurity and protection, and he's passed some licenses and things like that. We both are concerned about AI and social networking, getting people to doom scroll and get locked in their rooms, not participating and not being social.

We ended up talking about the cybersecurity being also a cause of people being scared and afraid, not wanting to click on links and all of that. We realized, or we talked about, the opposite would be that we find ways of using AI to be helpful, kind, and useful in fostering more social engagement and better activities for young people.

Together, we came up with the idea that we have a search term, a Twitter handle of cybersecurity, but the thing we're looking for is cyber inspiration. He thought that was a good idea. We might share that online or something like that.

The other thing I reminded him is that if you hold down on a letter, at least on an Android phone, lots of letters pop up and you can choose accented letters, so that would help people write his name with an accent because his name is L-A apostrophe M-E-R-E. Getting the accent in is tricky, but now on a phone, it's much easier.

There's probably a lot more, but that's enough for Lamar Carter right now. I hope we see him again and we have a good drone race and we find technology things in common. Bye for now.
