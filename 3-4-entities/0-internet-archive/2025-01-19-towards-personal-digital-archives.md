# 2025-01-19 Towards Personal Digital Archives


## Introduction

I am an older man that leads an interesting life with an interesting family background. I like to think that just as a number of my ancestors have done, I helped change the world mostly in a positive way,

For fifty years I have collected documents, images, photos, slides and negatives, drawings and objects that tell the story of my life and the lives of my ancestors.

It is the time get get much of this material digitized and shared with people who will appreciate it ~ now and forever.

## Current Status

While, many documents have already been scanned, the great majority of the images and objects have not. They are currently in a 10' x 20' storage unit in San Francisco.

Many of the documents are in binders and boxes and kept in folders and envelopes. The major task is to extract the actual documents from whatever they are in and to prepare them for sending off to be scanned.

## Planning

My thought is to have somebody has managed this sort of process to come to the storage unit, have a look at what is there and to prepare a proposal for how to proceed.

The actual preparation might be carried out by workers that the manager has at his or her disposal.

## Content Overview

Much of the material is of little interest, old telephone bills, for example. But, there are many gems too, such as the letters that my father wrote to my mother during the WWII.

In general I prefer to be a keeper rather than a thrower-awayer. But, I am open to suggestions. Personally, I find a telephone bill from the 1970s to be a fascinating thing. And I wonder what the historian of five hundred years from now will think of it.

## Estimating the Work
I have difficulty in estimating the number of items that need to be scanned. But, the number that comes to mind is a hundred boxes with a hundred items each - 10 thousand items but it is not likely to be twice that nor half that.

## Next Steps

What happens after the items are scanned and online is another matter. I have some ideas but I am open to suggestions. In any caseI plan to devotes much time to cataloging and curating the project in the coming years.

In my dreams, the effort becomes some king of extended reality timeline. Ultimately. I hope the project becomes a way to help people to design interesting lives of their own.

## Open Access

If the information contained in such a repository is to be useful, to have agency, to provide benefit then it must be freely accessible to all. This is the only way that the information can be used to help people to design interesting lives of their own.

My intent is to make all the information readily available and editable by being hosted on public repositories on GitHub and backed up on the Internet Archive.

## Creating the How-To Guide

There is little or no guidance available on how to get something like this done. I plan to create a how-to guide that will be freely available to all. This will be a living document that will be updated as new information becomes available on how to digitize and share personal archives, who to contact, what to do, and what not to do.

## Potential Partners

It seems to me that large libraries are often "hoarders" or collectors & maintainers of notable people's personal archives. There must be people somewhere who go and collect and assemble the material from people's houses and offices and put it into boxes. Any thoughts on this avenue would be useful.
