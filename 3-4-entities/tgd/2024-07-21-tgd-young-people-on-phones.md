## What does Haidt propose as a solution to the "Great Rewiring of Childhood"

Jonathan Haidt proposes several solutions to address the negative impacts of the "Great Rewiring of Childhood" caused by the rise of smartphones and social media. His recommendations focus on both individual and collective actions:

1. **Delay Smartphone Use**:
   * Haidt suggests that children should not have smartphones before high school. Instead, they should be given basic phones with limited functionality to delay their exposure to the internet and social media until they are older[4][5].

2. **Ban Smartphones in Schools**:
   * He advocates for banning smartphones in schools to reduce distractions and promote healthier social interactions among students[1][5].

3. **Encourage Play-Based Activities**:
   * Haidt emphasizes the importance of returning to a play-based childhood, which involves more physical activities and face-to-face interactions, crucial for healthy development[1][2].

4. **Collective Action and Policy Changes**:
   * He calls for collective action from parents, educators, tech companies, and governments to implement policies that limit screen time and protect children online. This includes legislative measures to regulate the use of smartphones and social media among young people[1][2][3].

5. **Parental and Educational Guidance**:
   * Haidt encourages parents and educators to model healthy phone use and to create environments that promote real-world social interactions over virtual ones[5].

By implementing these measures, Haidt believes it is possible to mitigate the adverse effects of the digital age on children's mental health and restore a more balanced and healthy childhood.

Hello Evan:

You raise a distressing yet fascinationg issue.

My first similar encounter was with Sherry Turkle's "Alone Together" published in 2017. Turkle's book was a wake-up call for many people about the impact of technology on human relationships. Since then, the rise of smartphones and social media has only intensified the concerns about the effects of digital technology on young people's mental health and social development.

I have two conjectures about the possible downside and possible upside of the "Great Rewiring of Childhood" caused by the rise of smartphones and social media.


## Possible Downside

Haidt proposes several solutions to address the negative impacts of the "Great Rewiring of Childhood" caused by the rise of smartphones and social media.

1. Delay Smartphone Use
2. Ban Smartphones in Schools
3. Encourage Play-Based Activities
4. Collective Action and Policy Changes
5. Parental and Educational Guidance

I can see all of these solutions being adapted by private schools and "high class" public schoolsand parents who can afford to send their children to private schools. However, the public school system is a different story. The public school system is already underfunded and overworked. It is unlikely that they will be able to implement these changes without significant (but inlikely) support from the government.

We then begin to see a divide between the children who can afford to go to private schools and those who cannot. The children who can afford to go to private schools will have a better chance of developing social skills and a healthier relationship with technology. The children who cannot afford to go to private schools will be left behind - educated by TikTok.

This leads to a _Brave New World_ scenario where the children who can afford to go to private schools will be the "alphas" and the children who cannot afford to go to private schools will be the "deltas".


## Possible Upside

Having been involved with designing the tools that most designers use to design things, I can give examples of how the tools I helped design ended up producing crap. I built the first demos of using clipart style components in Computer Aided Design. But now many housing developments are copy paste amalgamations of stuff that was shoddy to begin with. At the same time, CAD has enabled architects to design buildings that would have been impossible to build using paper.

We can and should make conjectures about bad things happenoiing because of our devices. But we should also make conjectures about the good things that can happen because of our devices.

My favorite cheat sheet on living the good life is the VIA Character Strengths. The VIA Character Strengths are a set of 24 positive traits that are valued across cultures and contribute to human flourishing. These strengths are organized into six categories:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Values_in_Action_Inventory_of_Strengths#Classification_of_strengths

* Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective
* Courage: bravery, persistence, integrity, zest
* Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence
* Justice: teamwork, fairness, leadership
* Temperance: forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, self control
* Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality

With every one of these virtues I can envisgae stories, videos, games - using both software and harware that enable people to idenify, acquire and maintain these strengths. I can see how such tools could serve to assist people to live better lives.

Yikes! I think I have some work to do here. ;-)
