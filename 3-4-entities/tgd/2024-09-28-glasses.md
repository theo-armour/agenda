## Ray-Ban

Heart the camera concept. But glasses, Superhexa Vision I had last year were better. They had a dusply so I could see the image of what I was looking at and they had very good 15x zoom. But the headset was mechanically primitive and the vendor failed.

I very much like that you can stream to Instagram. I just wish I had more things I need to stream in my life. I should try to stream the Wednesday lunch with Philip and me.

The AI is just OK. Not nearly as interactive as ChatGPT with realtime voice. Not as connected as Google Gemini.

Glasses are mostly designed for content consumers, not for content creators.

My vision was to be able to use the glasses as a multi-monitor setup on a laptop in a Paris cafe. But for now only one monitor is virtual on Windows (not on MacOS). The other is real. Switching eye focus between the two is distracting.

But no camera and no microphone.
