I see parallels between reading The Diaconal Hermeneutic and The Prophetic Imagination and the two that seem most aligned are the concepts of Prophet Informed, and Systemic and Critical.

The Diaconal Hermeneutic points out that essentially from the time of Constantine when Christianity became “official” the prophetic voice became muted and the church as a body is still recovering from that. Brueggemann addresses this when he writes that the dominant narratives of our society, often characterized by consumerism, individualism, and militarism, have stifled our imagination and limited our ability to envision a different reality. I would say that these dominant narratives are not new thus the effort to direct attention toward faith in action are greatly challenged by this that has been “cooked into” the psyche of our culture.

Brueggemann emphasizes the link between faith and social justice, and advocates for a more profound response to injustice. The Diaconal Hermeneutic makes the same points beginning with laying the groundwork for a hermeneutic that is not simply seen, heard, and dismissed as just the deacon’s personal crankiness of “political” stance or affiliation. The story of the people floundering in water from Plater’s Many Servants illustrates the hermeneutic in a way that challenges the common notions of community action found today.

The reading this week has brought to my mind and made me question the thousands of sandwiches (along with gathered groceries and toiletry items) made weekly by churches (this is a city wide, ecumenical effort) in my city and given out throughout the city to any residents in need or experiencing food insecurity. This service is much needed. But I now wonder what those same bodies are doing to address the cause(s) of this insecurity, if they’re addressing them at all. Our city council is focused on increasing housing density for increasing taxation (taxation to go toward funding socially unnecessary items like an MLB stadium – an effort made more egregious by the urgent need for more school buildings and low income housing) and they are far FAR outnumbered, and likely outfunded, by the number of people who are working in this ecumenical effort to address a real issue. I can easily imagine the upheaval that would initially occur if those involved in helping the food insecure were to take their organized effort and direct it at actions of city council to address and mitigate the causes of that insecurity. And, because of the sheer numbers involved, I can also easily imagine our ecumenical community causing some real and meaningful change.

In this example we see a dominant narrative that can be disrupted, and which leads to the creation of new possibilities for justice, compassion, and community. I like what we’re reading and I’m eager to learn more.

First of all, thank you for addressing the prophetic parallel since I’m still working to sort through that one. Your example of the sandwich distribution gets to another connection for me, heartbreak. It’s odd that in serving, it can feel like…perpetuating an injustice? Well intentioned, what if by addressing the acute need we are in fact fueling the chronic and systemic causes?

Enculturation and the Threat of Loss: Systemic and Critical with Heartbroken and Compassionate

I apologize for being a bit late to post…aligning book pages with audio (since my ability to read Braille is glacial at best) takes a bit of doing.  That said, here are a couple of early intersections that stood out for me.

In a graduate seminar on leadership studies I took a few years back, we struggled with the questions surrounding “hidden issues” (Harvard scholar Heifitz writes a great deal on this) and the role of institutional racism/sexism/pick your marginalizing-ism in maintaining power structures.  I see the last article on the Diaconal Hermeneutic and Brueggemann’s work as focusing different lenses to allow us to alternatively see or unsee what has become so engrained as to seem natural, even where it injures and perpetuates massive injustices. Whether it’s called institutionalized -isms or enculturation, this strikes me as the common thread of systemic oppression, and critically understanding such systems resides at identifying the root of suffering and injustice.

This same leadership seminar suggested that people in power don’t necessarily fear change; they fear loss.  So within the population of an oppressive society, the people in power have little incentive to change (the system is working well for them, after all) and the people at the margins are too busy focusing on survival to risk what little they have to truly focus on what others have or don’t have. This is why I suspect that treating individual acute needs seems far less daunting than addressing the chronic systemic issues creating the conditions behind such needs.  Brueggemann writes, “Prophetic criticism aims to create an alternative consciousness with its own rhetoric and field of perception” (at page 99). As with the Diaconal Hermeneutic, then, we are tasked with being able to apply a new lens to the status quo and to make visible what is hidden or what is uncomfortable to see…and to invite others to not only view through such lenses, but to act upon what they see (the “real” part of the equation).  This is seen in Brueggemann’s repeated reference to the “numb and denying” masses that allow perpetuation of majority power structures/dominant culture at others’ expense.

Where I see another critical intersection is the Diaconal Hermeneutic’s “heartbroken and compassionate,” with Brueggeman’s emphasis on pathos, as he writes, “…the only way to penetrate that numbed consciousness of denial was by the public presentation of grief (the crucifixion),” (at p. 81). I’m still unpacking this a bit, but it seems like the generation of deep heartache and compassion towards suffering is what the deacon both utilizes to uncover the larger hidden issues, and has to fully evoke in others in order to mobilize enough people to effectuate real change.

Dear Melissa and Karen

Well put.

Both of you.

Being an outsider, I am having trouble (and pleasure) in parsing the intricacies of dealing with the Episcopal Church and its many manifestations. On the other hand I well sense and feel the pain and the need for change that you both urge.

Sadly I can only add to the dilemma. Last year I wrote a letter to the New York Times about what could I as an individual do to alleviate the problem of the unhoused here in San Francisco. Their response was succinct and to the point: "Nothing."

Nonetheless, if the Church is to foment change, then my guess is that it is most likely to be done from within the deaconate. Could an assembly of deacons muster the power and imagination to change the narrative.


Dear Melissa and Karen,

Well put.

Both of you.

As an outsider unfamiliar with the intricacies of the Episcopal Church and its various expressions, I find myself both challenged and intrigued. Nonetheless, I deeply resonate with the pain you've articulated, as well as the urgent call for change.

Unfortunately, I fear I may only add to the complexity of the situation. Last year, I wrote a letter to the New York Times, asking what could I do as an individual to alleviate the problem of the unhoused here in San Francisco. Their reply was blunt and disheartening: "Nothing."

Nevertheless, I believe that if significant change is to occur within the Church, it will likely stem from within the diaconate. Could an assembly of deacons gather the necessary power and creativity to shift the prevailing narrative?

Warm regards,

Theo
