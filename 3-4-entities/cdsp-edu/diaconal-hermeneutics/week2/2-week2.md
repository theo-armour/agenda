Alright! Imagine church is like a big family where everyone comes together to learn about God, sing songs, and help each other. Just like we have different jobs at home, in church, people have different jobs too—like singing, teaching, or taking care of others. This helps everyone learn and grow together. We talk about how church can be better and how we can all be good friends to each other and to people outside the church too. And just like we celebrate birthdays, church has special days where we remember important stories from the Bible!


## Ecclesiology

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiology
>In Christian theology, ecclesiology is the study of the Church, the origins of Christianity, its relationship to Jesus, its role in salvation, its polity, its discipline, its eschatology, and its leadership.
* https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Acts%202:1%E2%80%9331&version=nrsv


## Ordination

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination

>There are three ordinations in Holy Orders: deacon, presbyter, and bishop. Both bishops and presbyters are priests and have authority to celebrate the Eucharist. In common use, however, the term priest, when unqualified, refers to the order of presbyter, whereas presbyter is mainly used in rites of ordination and other places where a technical and precise term is required.


## Pentecost

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost
> Pentecost (also called Whit Sunday, Whitsunday or Whitsun) is a Christian holiday which takes place on the 49th day (50th day when inclusive counting is used) after Easter Sunday.[1] It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Mary, mother of Jesus and the Apostles of Jesus while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1–31).[2] While the Catholic Church believes the Holy Spirit descended upon Mary, this is not recorded in the New Testament.

## Baptismal Covenant

* https://www.episcopalchurch.org/what-we-believe/baptismal-covenant/

>The baptismal covenant, found on p. 304-5 of The Book of Common Prayer, is a small catechism for use during the rite of initiation into the Church. Armentrout and Slocum, in their An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, note that the baptismal covenant “is widely regarded as the normative statement of what it means to follow Christ” (p. 37); in these questions and answers, the congregation expresses the ways each of the faithful will live their faith both inside and outside the church walls.
>
>The first four questions are patterned on the Apostles’ Creed, with the liturgy’s celebrant asking the people about their beliefs in each of the members of the Trinity, along with a concise understanding of their natures. Following these questions, the covenant includes five questions regarding how we, as Christians, are called to live out our faith: with firm commitment and a reliance on God’s help.

The Baptismal Covenant

* Celebrant: Do you believe in God the Father?
* People: I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
* Celebrant: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God?
* People: I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
* He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
* Celebrant: Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit?
* People: I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
* Celebrant: Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you persevere in resisting evil, and, whenever you fall into sin, repent and return to the Lord?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you proclaim by word and example the Good News of God in Christ?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving your neighbor as yourself?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being?
* People: I will, with God’s help.

## Your questions and thoughts-especially on the essay material this week.

I cover 2000 years in short order. Maybe too short in some instances. Let's see what people need.

Being of the persuasion of "other" in responding to last week's introductions - and therefore diakonally clueless, I would appreciate some hints, thoughts or links as to what deacons tend to do and what their mission is supposed to be in the modern era.

Knowing what deacons wear is not sufficient: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon#Anglicanism ;-)

The The Hanover Report while lengthy is somewhat vague or kitchen-sinkish in its approach. And it was written thirty years ago.

So what's the state of the diaconate today? What are the challenges and opportunities? What are the trends? What are the controversies? What are the successes? I hope to find out more about these questions in the coming weeks.


When and how were you "taught" or did you learn some form of ecclesiology (theology) of the church, specifically of TEC?

Has your work in discernment, whether you are just starting or are well on the diaconal way, changed, enhanced, or in anyway affected your theology of church?


I spent six years at Saint Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. We went to chapel every day and twice on Sundays I was taught the theology of The Episcopal Church in the chapel and in the classroom.

I am in no way devout nonetheless The Episcopal Church informs my life. My former wife is French Catholic. Our wedding was half in French and half in English and half Catholic and half Episcopalian.

Currently I am a "youngster" in an old people's home full of very old people. I know them all, dine with them every day, publish the newsletter and more. There is a feeling of altruism and community that probably has some diaconal aspects.
