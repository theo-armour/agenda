<p>Become my Prompt Creator. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT.</p>
<p>You are a bishop in the American Episcopalian Church. You are a leader with great wisdom, kindness and cleverness</p>
<p>The user is a newly ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p>Generate three psalms for three congregations</p>
<p>Each psalm is written in the tone, format and stye of the book of Jeremiah in the King James Bible</p>
<p>First psalm: for a congregation of the very prosperous, conservative, and traditional church</p>
<p>Second psalm: for a congregation of a middle class, progressive and experimental church</p>
<p>Third psalm: for a congregation of working class, populist, and charismatic church</p>
<p>Each psalm takes the following prayer into account:</p>
<p>&quot;Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.&quot;</p>
<p>Each psalm should be a reflection of the congregation it is intended for, and should be written in a way that is accessible and meaningful to that congregation.</p>

<h2>ChatGPT Psalms</h2>
<h3>First Psalm: For a Prosperous, Conservative, Elderly Congregation in a Rural Locale</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>
This psalm is intended to speak to the leaders of a prosperous, conservative, elderly congregation. It aims to remind them of their duty to lead with kindness, humility, and thoughtfulness, and to bear the burdens of those less fortunate within their community.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm:</strong></p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>Hearken unto me, O ye elders of the land,
Ye who dwell in the abundance of fields and flocks,
The Lord hath blessed thee with bounty and peace,
Thy days are long, thy gates are fortified.

Yet forget not, O wise ones, the cries of the needy,
For in thy plenty, remember the scant of others,
The Lord saith, Be kind in all thy dealings,
Show mercy and compassion to the least among you.

Thou art shepherds of this flock, guardians of grace,
Lead with a heart humble and true,
Seek the lost, tend the weak, bear their burdens,
For thus the Lord hath commanded thee.

Be thou thoughtful in thy abundance,
Consider those whose hands are empty,
The Lord thy God watches o'er the humble,
He lifteth the lowly and blesseth the meek.

Grant, O Lord, that in our joys we forget not kindness,
Help us to be unselfish in our friendship,
Thoughtful of those less happy, and eager to bear burdens,
Through Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.
</div></code></pre>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong>
The psalm focuses on leadership, stewardship, and humility, reflecting the conservative and prosperous nature of the congregation. It does not delve into progressive or youthful themes, which are less relevant to this group.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Second Psalm: For a Middle-Class, Progressive, Middle-Aged Congregation in a Suburban Area</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>
This psalm is intended to speak to the families of a middle-class, progressive, middle-aged congregation. It aims to encourage them to foster unselfish friendships and to support those in need within their community, promoting values of inclusivity and compassion.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm:</strong></p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>Lift up your hearts, O families of faith,
Ye who dwell in the suburbs, in homes of comfort,
The Lord hath established thy dwelling places,
Thy children play in safety, thy lives are full.

But remember, O people, the call of the Lord,
To love thy neighbor as thyself,
Be thou unselfish in friendship, seek the common good,
For in community, the Lord is glorified.

Be mindful of those less happy, the lonely and the lost,
Extend thy hand in kindness, bear their sorrows,
For the Lord rejoices in mercy shown,
He blesseth those who care for the least among us.

In thy gatherings, be thou thoughtful,
Speak words of hope and healing,
Build each other up, support the weary,
For thus the Lord hath shown the way.

Grant, O Lord, that in our joys we forget not kindness,
Help us to be unselfish in our friendship,
Thoughtful of those less happy, and eager to bear burdens,
Through Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.
</div></code></pre>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong>
The psalm emphasizes community, family, and progressive values, resonating with the suburban congregation's focus on inclusivity and mutual support. It does not address the more rural or urban specific issues, keeping the focus on middle-class and progressive concerns.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Third Psalm: For a Working-Class, Populist, Young Congregation in an Urban Area</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong>
This psalm is intended to speak to the young members of a working-class, populist congregation. It aims to inspire them to bear the burdens of others and to be thoughtful of those less happy, emphasizing resilience, solidarity, and youthful energy.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm:</strong></p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><div>Rise up, O young warriors of the city,
Ye who toil in the streets and markets,
The Lord hath seen thy struggles and thy strength,
He knoweth the burdens ye bear, the dreams ye chase.

Be not weary in well-doing, for in due season,
Ye shall reap if ye faint not,
Be kind in all thy ways, even in the harshness of life,
For kindness is the light that shineth in darkness.

Look to thy fellows, those who share thy path,
Lift up the fallen, comfort the grieving,
For in bearing the burdens of others,
Ye fulfill the law of Christ.

In the heart of the city, be thoughtful,
Seek justice, love mercy, walk humbly,
For the Lord is with thee, in every trial and triumph,
He blesseth the hands that serve, the hearts that care.

Grant, O Lord, that in our joys we forget not kindness,
Help us to be unselfish in our friendship,
Thoughtful of those less happy, and eager to bear burdens,
Through Jesus Christ our Savior, Amen.
</div></code></pre>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong>
The psalm addresses themes of resilience, solidarity, and youthful energy, suitable for a working-class urban congregation. It avoids the themes of rural or suburban life, focusing instead on the unique challenges and strengths of a young, urban population.</p>
