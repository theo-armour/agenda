Key for us in our discussion is his assertion that we must understand that prophets are always understood as being the ones God has inspired to promote alteration of the current state by saying and doing less than popular things in a context of totalism, which is an enemy of imagination.  The bureaucracy and its proponents, which pretty much overshadows the people on the margins we are to serve as followers of Jesus’ example, are not interested in economies where the gains go across the spectrum.  They will resist change impacting the status quo at the expense of innovation, inclusion, and alternative views of socially accepted norms to ensure things stay titled towards justifying the need for this same bureaucracy.

Play might be a useful tool in creating a more collaborative and less threatening environment for these endeavors

I will add that even at the parish level, my practical experience says that many individuals that make up the “mature parishioner” core of any parish, will also feel a need to resist change if they fear a loss of influence, recognition, value, power, or status.  In a declining church that is aging out like so many Episcopal church parishes in the area I reside, this is usually 10% or less of the ASA but can be 3 to 6 people who support renewal and embracing new invitees into the church but want to keep their status quo which is in opposition to their statement of change

So as a deacon I see the ability to build consensus’ around change at any level of the church that penetrates one of these sacred vails to be a great obstacle.

A great professor of mine recently said those who know their Gospel scripture usually can succeed in finding a way to articulate a contemporary phrased view of the scripture IF they first recognize that many who you seek to engage/persuade are familiar with both scripture and liturgical prayer and inside the tent already.  But for the growing number folk who know nothing of the Bible other than its egregious public misuse or nothing or worse Hollywood’s version, you’ll need to listen carefully to their thoughts, needs and desires and meet them where they are before using the same remarks.


And think of how the practical side of the BCP can help us here.  I believe that is key to overcoming this obstacle in the path of growing closer as the one church built around what we have in common rather than highlighting what separates us or makes us different.


## Education and Exposure

Preface: I am an equestrian and continually train to see obstacles as something I am helping my horse get over, they aren't about me or my feelings in that moment


All of this is to say that I’m living (and soon to be interning) in an environment where the role of the deacon is not widely explained, modeled, or understood.
