Three Songs for Three Congregations

A very traditional way of making a psalm come to life is to transform the psalm to a song.

Using https://suno.com/, going from text to a sing is a cinch. Here are the three psalms generated yesterday morphed into songs. If you click on the links, you will be taken to a Suno web page where you can hear the generated song, view the lyrics, and view the album cover

Psalm 1: A Call to Righteous Leadership

For a prosperous, conservative, elderly congregation in a rural locale

Prompt: English choir singing psalm as a chant

First version: https://suno.com/song/8d461c52-a1de-429d-a845-23830269d429

Second version: https://suno.com/song/aaebdd47-7811-482b-bb29-c6bf8f457699

Psalm 2: A Vision of Compassionate Community

For a middle-class, progressive, middle-aged congregation in a suburban area

Prompt: A female top40 artist singing psalm in metrical form

First version: https://suno.com/song/5ebb1be1-7319-4635-81f7-b32946884123

Second version: https://suno.com/song/24c812fd-8691-40f5-891e-c5483d9eee6a

Psalm 3: A Cry for Justice and Compassion

For a working-class, populist, young congregation in an urban area

Prompt: Afropop

First version: https://suno.com/song/24c812fd-8691-40f5-891e-c5483d9eee6a

Second version: https://suno.com/song/b69ffbb5-937c-41ff-af21-14f4dfc03a2e
This last one is my favorite

Conclusion
I feel if I really put my mind to it, I could write the text of a psalm as good as any of these, though this would take many hours boning up on correct liturgical text. But turning the psalms into songs could not be done by me in a hundred years.

And, goodness, to my untrained ear, Suno does an amazingly good job - in less than a minute per song.

So, unlike yesterday where I could consider the text to be merely blasphemous, today I can have a sensation of being in the presence of the work of the devil. ;-)

Now, Let's see what AI can do with the psalms tomorrow!
