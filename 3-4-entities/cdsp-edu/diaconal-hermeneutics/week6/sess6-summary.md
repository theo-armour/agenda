# Detailed Summary of Session Six: The Dream of God

**Session Six** of the Diaconal Hermeneutic course delves deeply into the metaphor of the "Plumb Line" and its application to diaconal ministry, centering around the concept of the "Dream of God."

## The Plumb Line Metaphor

- **Plumb Line as a Standard**: The Plumb Line symbolizes an objective and unwavering standard, transcending subjective thoughts, personal feelings, cultural, and historical contexts. It represents the truth of God’s vision for the world, rooted in the teachings of Jesus and the prophets, and serves as a guiding principle for interpreting the needs and directions of the church.
- **Historical and Scriptural Foundation**: This standard is derived not from an esoteric or archaic Christian tradition but from the core teachings of Jesus, often referred to as the Kingdom of God or Kingdom of Heaven. This concept needs reframing in modern times to avoid misinterpretations associated with monarchical language.

## Reframing the Kingdom of God

- **Modern Sensibilities**: Traditional monarchical imagery can imply top-down rule, patriarchy, and privilege, often enforced with violence. To address this, the term "Holy Reign of God" or more recently "the Dream of God" has been adopted. This new terminology aims to convey God's vision without the baggage of historical and cultural connotations.
- **Avoiding Political Misappropriation**: Terms like "Building the Kingdom" have been co-opted by movements like Christian Nationalism, which use it as a code for theocratic agendas. Maintaining an uncorrupted vocabulary is essential for deacons to effectively communicate God’s vision without contemporary political baggage.

## The Dream of God

- **Origins and Influence**: The term "Dream of God" has been popularized by leaders like The Most Rev. Michael B. Curry and has roots in the work of figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. It emphasizes a vision of justice, peace, and right relationships, encapsulating the essence of Jesus’ teachings.
- **Immanence of the Kingdom**: Jesus taught that the Kingdom of God is very near, a greater reality waiting to break into our collective life. This contrasts with the historical misinterpretation that relegates the Kingdom to a distant, otherworldly reward.

## The Role of the Deacon

- **Interpreting and Communicating**: Deacons are charged with interpreting the needs, concerns, and hopes of the world through the lens of the Plumb Line—God’s vision for right relationships. This involves guiding the church to engage in actions that reflect this vision, promoting reconciliation and justice.
- **Historical Continuity and Renewal**: The renewal of the diaconate, particularly in the 20th century, emphasizes the deacon’s role in serving the world. This renewal was inspired by critical reflections on past failures and a commitment to prevent future atrocities, as seen in the re-establishment of the Order of Deacons in the Roman Catholic Church post-Vatican II.

## Theological and Philosophical Considerations

- **Cosmological Shifts**: Historical misunderstandings of the Kingdom and heaven were influenced by changing cosmological views, such as the conflict over Galileo’s heliocentrism. These shifts reflect deeper issues in the church’s adaptability to new knowledge and understandings of the world.
- **Social Control and Misuse**: The concept of heaven as an otherworldly reward has been used as a tool for social control, critiqued by thinkers like Karl Marx and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. This misuse distorts the true intent of the Kingdom as a transformative, immanent reality.

## Practical Applications

- **Blueprint for Action**: The Baptismal Covenant serves as a blueprint for realizing the Dream of God, outlining commitments to justice, peace, and reconciliation. Deacons play a crucial role in helping the church "get it" and take actionable steps towards this vision.
- **Historical Examples**: Figures like Walter Rauschenbusch, who emphasized the social implications of the Kingdom, and the renewal of the diaconate in response to atrocities like those in Dachau, highlight the enduring relevance and transformative potential of the Dream of God.

## Key Quotes and Concepts

- **Resources for the Holy Reign of God**: The session includes a list of resources and quotes that reflect core Kingdom values, such as justice, peace, forgiveness, and the universal human capacity for God. These resources serve as tools for deacons to deepen their understanding and communicate the Dream of God effectively.

## Conclusion

Session Six of the Diaconal Hermeneutic course reaffirms the importance of the Plumb Line as a guiding principle for deacons, emphasizing the need to reframe traditional concepts in ways that resonate with contemporary sensibilities and avoid political misappropriation. The Dream of God, as a vision of right relationships and justice, is central to the deacon’s ministry, guiding the church towards actions that reflect God’s will for humanity.
