## Diakonally Clueless

Being of the persuasion of "other" in responding to last week's introductions - and therefore diakonally clueless, I would appreciate some hints, thoughts or links as to what deacons tend to do and what their mission is supposed to be in the modern era.

Knowing what deacons wear is not sufficient: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon#Anglicanism ;-)

The Hanover Report while lengthy is somewhat vague or kitchen-sinkish in its approach. And it was written thirty years ago.

So, what's the state of the diaconate today? What are the challenges and opportunities? What are the trends? What are the controversies? What are the successes? I hope to find out more about these questions in the coming weeks.
