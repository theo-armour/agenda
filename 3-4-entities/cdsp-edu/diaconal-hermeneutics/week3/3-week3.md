## The Diaconate: A Full and Equal Order Paperback – January 1, 1995

https://www.amazon.com/Diaconate-Full-Equal-Order/dp/1563380935

This book is a highly readable, comprehensive study that has established itself as the definitive work on the diaconate. Drawing upon original sources, the book provides valuable insights into the development of the office of the deacon in the early church and situates it within the context of the church's total ministry. Dr. Barnett contends that a radical change in the nature and understanding of the church's ministry took place in the fourth century. A ministry that had included the whole people of God in a horizontal, organic structure gave way to one that was clerical and hierarchical. This change, among other factors, eventually transformed the diaconate into an inconsequential, transitional office on the way to the priesthood. Responding to the present-day revival of the diaconate in the Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, and other churches, Barnett calls for a restoration of the office to its original place as full and equal order, thus re-creating the great symbol of the servant ministry that Christ gave to all the church. James Monroe Barnett, now living in retirement in Omaha, is the former rector of Trinity Episcopal Church, Norfolk, NE.

## Charism

In the Catholic tradition, charism is a spiritual gift or grace given to Christians by the Holy Spirit to help them represent Christ and be a channel of God's goodness for others. Charisms are also known as "favor" or "gratuitous gift" in the New Testament, and come from the Greek word charis.

Charisms FAQ - Catherine of Siena Institute - Colorado Springs, CO
"Charism" is the Greek word used in the New Testament for "favor" or "gratuitous gift." Charisms, or spiritual gifts, are special abilities given to all Christians by the Holy Spirit to give them power both to represent Christ and to be a channel of God's goodness for people.

Catholic Identity
Charism - Catholic Identity
Charism comes from the Greek word (charis) used in the New Testament for 'favour' or 'freely given gift' from God. So charisms, or spiritual gifts, are gifts given through the grace of the Holy Spirit to enable followers of Jesus to become powerful channels of God's love and presence in the world.

Charism - St Mary's Primary School Ipswich
The word charism, in the tradition of the Church, refers to spiritual gifts used for the service of the whole community. These gifts or graces of the Holy Spirit are given to individuals and groups for the sake of others.
Charisms are believed to help Christians fulfill the mission of the Church. For example, some people may have a charism of evangelization, while others may have a charism of teaching. Charisms are given to individuals and groups for the sake of others.

Some signs of a charism include:

* An unmistakable inner experience of peace, energy, and joy when using the gift
* Unusually effective and successful results in what you're trying to accomplish
* Other people's direct or indirect recognition of the gift's presence
Every religious congregation has a spirituality that reflects the spirituality of its founder, and this is known as its charism. For example, the Sisters of St. Francis of Perpetual Adoration have a charism of perpetual adoration, which means they adore the Sacred Heart of Jesus in the Eucharist.

## The "Ministry" section of the Lima Document.

There is a lot packed into this relatively brief statement. After years of assessing, weighting, and being in dialog about "Orders" this is what those working for Christian Unity at the planetary level discerned to be in common among most of world Christianity, and what were the points of difference about which there has been a commitment to continue in dialog. The Roman Catholic Church does not belong to the WCC but is a consitent, and welcomed, observer. The largest "missing piece" is the proliferation of protestant expression that are often very local, very particular in their origins (a dispute over almost anything that divides first a congregation and then some others drawn to the issue at hand. The Pentecostal world stands apart as well.
Thus the document represents a high degree of consensus (in both what is agreed and what is agreed needs more work) for Christianitiy in the 20th century.

## Teasing out Emphasis and Qualities

As a direct response to Rod's question Melissa's response says it all.

As I techie coming across the TEC BCP for the first time in a very long time, I say "OMG, what a beautiful FAQ!"

Nonetheless, tease I must. For me, the Q&As of the Catechism state the duties and functions of the three orders. I immediately think of Rod's words here:

"...into the silence I chirped, 'well, if we start with ‘form follows function’ we...' and before I could finish my sentence the leader slammed his hand on the table and shouted 'NO!'  He quickly explained that functionalism was the great foundational misunderstanding, or error, in our accounting for orders."

Rod continues:

"The gifts of the Spirit given/signed through the laying on of hands is not conferring a job description or to-do list but the enlivening of core qualities for the goals, the good, the mission of the community of faith as church."

My tease: Where are Saint Augustine's words that a sacrament as "outward and visible signs of inward and spiritual graces"?

Wait, there's more!

In his paper, referring to the Hebrew Bible, Rod writes:

"Three complementary qualities of community each have their clear leadership - prophet, priest, and king."

I imagine that these qualities will appear again in our diaconal studies.
