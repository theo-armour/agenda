Hi Hailey

Thank you for sending the link to the LearningTogether post:

https://www.togetherplatform.com/blog/ai-in-learning-and-development

I enjoyed reading the post and agree with many of the points it makes. Nonetheless, I am not sure if it is a good fit for what you may be trying to accomplish.

In general, it is preferable **not** to link to websites that:

* Try to sell you something (Call to action: "Book a demo")
* Post without stating the name of the author (which indicates advertising copy)
* Links in the post only point to internal pages on the same website
* Posts have no references to peer reviewed papers or other evidence
* Posts that make suggestions without helping you identify the targets and metrics to accomplish the objectives

In general, it seems preferable to link to websites that are more neutral and provide more information. For example, websites that offer:

* Beginner-friendly tools
* Free resources
* Open-source tools
* Standard-establishing tools
* Tools promoting cooperation rather than competition

I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any questions.

I would be pleased to help with drafting a "catechism" that begins to define the standards for implementing AI and IT in general for the Episcopal Deaconry.

Cheers,

Theo
