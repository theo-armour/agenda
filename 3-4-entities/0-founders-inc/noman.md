Hi Noman. I enjoyed our chat yesterday evening. You are tackling a beautifully complicated and very real and very error prone topic. It requires both AI knowledge and real world domain knowledge. And you appear to have both. ;-)

BTW:

I am not sure if you are aware of this, but Microsoft has a new IDE for Postgres in VS Code. It is very nice. I have been using it for a few weeks now. It is a bit buggy, but I think it will be a great tool once they work out the bugs.
