V clean ~ I know what you do

And

Are you real people?

In this day of AI, what is real? Do you have vibes or do you have wisdom?

Want  ~ links, transcripts?

Opportunities

* NACC ~ https://directory.contactcenterpipeline.com/
* https://www.norcalcontactcenters.org/

***

To the future.

* Soon the medical insurance companies will have their own bots, so it will be bot against bot.
* Gather the knowledge about how to deal with these companies.
* Sell the information about which companies create the longest accounts receivable, which ones are the most problematic and why, and what could be done.
Learn how to build bots for the insurance companies to reply to your bots.
* Create a secret language between the bots.
* Eventually, computers imitating people will be hated. Be prepared. Have some other irons in the fire.

Hi Rob

Hi Suhail. I enjoyed our chat yesterday evening. You are tackling a health industry issue that is disturbingly huge and harmful. And you seem well on your way to helping to solve it.

I will contact my "nephew" with the call canter business in the Philippines, and put you in touch with him if he is interested or has contact who might be interested.

Fingers crossed: 50,000 calls per week soon!
