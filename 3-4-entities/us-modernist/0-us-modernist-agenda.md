Hi George

Where have you been all my life? https://usmodernist.org/ is the absolute cat's pyjamas of architectural websites!!

You special thing is dealing with a history of something as an activity or even a verb. Very lively!

I have just signed up for Mod Squad. Allow me to dream of setting up a chapter in San Francisco. ;-)

But forgive me, currently I am working for the enemy. I live in a Julia Morgan building ~ https://heritageonthemarina.org/. Tudor Revival of all things. But I heart it anyway. It's celebrating its centenary this year and I am documenting its history. Nonetheless I will use your archive resources to explore for interesting references.

More later. In te meantime, here is a blast from the early AutoCAD days:

Hi Theo, I’m a longtime donor as well, and I aspire to IA’s greatness by curating the world’s largest archive for midcentury modern architecture.  My dad was one of the first to adopt AutoCAD back in his town nearly 40 years ago.  It would be great to talk with you!


Kind regards,

George Smart
