Hi Chris

Thank you for the detailed and very complete response to my draft.

I will transmit your version to Jason Carman and personally encourage him to reach out to you.

I will also forward similar documents and personal encouragements to:

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/engelhardt/ ~ a long-time angel
* https://kattahlab.ucsf.edu/people/michael-kattah-md-phd ~ my gastroenterologist

I plan to copy all three of you on the emails so you can see what I have written. Please let me know if you would prefer a different distribution

BTW, I am not a founder of Autodesk (though a friend of many of the 13 founders)

* I founded the first AutoCAD dealership in Asia in 1984
* From 1986 to 1991 ~ as a consultant to Autodesk I was sent all over China and East Asia to prepare organizations such as Jiao Tong University, Samsung & TSMC on how to use AutoCAD to build factories and other things. It worked.EEndiatx: draft
* 1991 to 1998 ~ I designed three releases of AutoCAD

More recentlyI have been involved

* Promoting Three.js as the premium open source 3D JavaScript library
* Developer and Maintainer of the 3D viewer for https://gbxml.org/

Over the years I have been much more the tech founder rather then the business founder
