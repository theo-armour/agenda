Heritage Happenings

Hi Trish, Margaret, and Martha Nell

We discussed many things today. It's difficult to remember all of it. Here are some highlights:

* We would like to revert to the name "Heritage Happenings"
* More than anything we need writers
* The stories that resonate are stories that involve residents
* Martha Nell is working on a story about the garden and donations to the garden
* Martha Nell will prepare Library Corner page
* We hope that Trish can work on stories about the Board and perhaps Marcia Forman.

Things we did not discuss but seem evident:

* Martha Nell is working on a story about Jon Casey?
* Margaret to research and amplify the special events for the month and wel as fact check the issue before it goes to print
* Theo to assemble the content, pass through grammar checker software and prepare the layout for final proofreading and printing
