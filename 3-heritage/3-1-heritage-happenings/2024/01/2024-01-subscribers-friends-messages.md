January 2024: Heritage Happenings

***

Hello Heritage Resident

Your digital copy of the January issue of Heritage Happenings is attached.

This includes all three publications: Newsletter, Calendar and Residents Directory.

I have figured out how to squeeze the tablet-sized Calendar onto a letter-sized page. So you can now print it out on your home printer.

Things to note:

* The name of Nancy's Cat on page 14 is Lili
* The name of the the Japanese lacquerware monk on page 1 is Darma and he is a resident of apartment 227
* The "Aging in Place" editorial on page four mentions "five levels of service" for residents on the Type C Contract. I will be looking into what this means in more detail in the coming months.

Happy New Year!

Hello family and friends

Your digital copy of the January issue of Heritage Happenings is attached.

This includes two of the three publications: Newsletter and Calendar. The Residents Directory is not attached.

I continue to develop the format and layout. Interestingly, the whole publication is created using Microsoft Word because the writing and editing is done by a number of people using Word. I then convert the Word document to PDF.

The article on page nine "Rooms #5 ~ Back to New York ~ On to San Francisco" was written by Margaret Johnson. Margaret will be one hundred years old on April 2nd. She is already warming up her typing fingers for the next installment of her memoirs.

BTW, I am neither a newspaper man nor graphic designer. I am a software developer. I am learning as I go. And I am always open to your suggestions and ideas.

Happy New Year!

Hello Heritage on the Marina Board of Directors

Your digital copy of the January issue of Heritage Happenings is attached. It includes all three publications: Newsletter, Calendar and Residents Directory.

My hope for the Heritage Happenings for 2024 is that every month there will be at least a small article relating to activities by the Board, or Residents Council or team members. It could be a few words about your committee, or a few words about your thoughts on the future of Heritage. There is so much happening with the Strategic Plan, the Financial Plan and Aging in Place that I am sure there will always something to write about and share with resiuents.

Happy New Year!
