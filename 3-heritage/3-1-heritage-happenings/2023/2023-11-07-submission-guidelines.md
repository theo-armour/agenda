# 2023-11-07 Heritage Happenings Submission Guidelines

Hello people concerned with Heritage Happenings

Hello Karina and Roxana

I have started a guideline document for submitting articles to the *Heritage Happenings* newsletler so that your content is easier to edit and format content for the current latou. A DoC file  is attached.

I hope most material is self-explanatory. I hope we have a moment at this afternoon's meeting to discuss the guidelines and any questions you may have.

Theo
