All The Beauty In The World by Patrick Bringley
Review by Trish Otstott

A national bestseller book that is a must read.!

After Patrick Bringley lost his brother, Tom, at an early age due to cancer, he craved solace, calm and beauty. He quit his job at the New Yorker magazine and ran to the haven of all things beautiful - the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Fifth Avenue in New York.

He accepted the job, trained and began a ten year career as one of the museum’s
uniformed security guards. Every day the security supervisor assigned each guard a gallery or room to guard by standing while observing or by watchfully moving around the space. ”A twelve hour day on wood is like an eight hour day on marble. An eight
Hour day on wood is like nothing. Your feet will barely hurt.”

This book is chocked full of Patrick’s joy of standing for hours and contemplating rare
Egyptian artifacts, old master paintings, modern art, ancient relics and art from around the world. The museum offers pieces that represent 5,000 years of world culture.

In his narrative, Patrick observes all the various types of visitors (visitors from out of town, locals, repeats, students) and enjoys seeing families visiting with children in tow. One day Patrick had to warn one little boy not to touch the ancient marbles. The boy looked around at the bits and pieces of all sorts of Egyptian sculptures and statuary and asked, “Did all this damage happen in here?”

While on duty, Patrick is asked for directions as well as all sorts of normal and bizarre questions. My favorite: “Where is the Mona Lisa?”

This book is an elegant read and I think you will enjoy it. The print version is currently in the Heritage library. If you have access to the audio version, you will be delighted to hear the author’s voice reading the text.


Foster
Reviewed by Gardner Haskell

Foster by Claire Keegan is a long, short story that has recently been republished as a standalone novella. The story is the basis of the 2022 movie The Quiet Girl.
This first person memoir takes place in 1981 and is narrated by a young child. Her impoverished family have sent her to live on a farm with distant relatives to ease the burden of feeding and caring for her while her mother prepares for the arrival of yet another baby.
Keegan’s writing technique has been compared to what we now call the minimalist stye that began with Chekhov, furthered by Hemmingway, Raymond Carver and Amy Hempel where all detail is not explained to the reader and we become involved with the interpretation.
Much lies below the surface of this book about love and loss. The child tells us directly what she is seeing without adult recollections or judgments. This story begins when the child’s father drives her after Mass one summer Sunday “…deep towards the coast where my mother's people came from.” She has no idea what to expect — whether she'll be worked hard or treated kindly. She doesn’t know when she’ll be brought home again.
Keegan portrays the swings of mood for this child. For example, she sees clean kitchen tiles, daisies on the table, the aroma of disinfectant and bleach and the rhubarb tart in the oven all strike her as remarkable. With the loving guidance of the Kinsellas, the girl undergoes a transformation. In the Kinsellas' house she finds an affection and warmth she has not known and slowly, in their care, begins to blossom. Mrs. Kinsella bathes her, cleans her filthy fingernails. When Mrs. Kinsella starts to see the effects of their care, she says, "All you need is minding.” The reader understands the girl was a victim of neglect.
Keegan shows how painful unaccustomed love and tenderness can be because they accentuate what's been lacking. Walking to the beach with Mr. Kinsella, he thoughtfully adjusts his strides to the child's and takes her hand. She notes, "My father has never once held my hand.”
The story gets complicated when the girl’s mother writes to the Kinsellas, saying she wants the girl back.
This child is not the all-talking Anne of Green Gables where that ten year old plucky orphan kept constantly describing her world. The girl in Foster describes only what she sees, somewhat like a movie camera so we, as audience, can participate in viewing this book. Usually the crisis of the plot and the protagonist’s character arc come before the ending and then we have resolution. However, his book grips us with its last sentence.

Finally; A River Cruise

Since the winter of 2019, I had been no further than Sacramento. The next spring my daughter and I had planned on taking a Danube cruise, which was cancelled due to Covid. . So we moved it forward to 2021. Again, it had to be cancelled. Then again in 2022. Finally, in April we left for our river cruise on the AmaPrima . This time it was on the Main/Rhine Rivers. We added stays in Prague pre-cruise and Amsterdam post-cruise.

As I traveled, I thought about the many elements that draw me to traveling.

Unique experiences.

A Foodie Walking Tour with stops at five different dining venues in Old Prague.

Food Beautiful Food

In hotels - The Restaurant at the AlmanacX Hotel in Prague has a chef who has introduced a concept called Plant Forward, featuring many plant-based foods. Favorite dishes where BBQ cabbage and catfish with radish and trout caviar

The cultural institutions

This time in Amsterdam it wasn’t the Rembrandts that beckoned at the Rijksmuseum but the Vermeer show, which had 28 or his 5 extant paintings. Over 4300 people a day for five months visited the exhibit. The nearby Van Gogh Museum certainly didn’t lack for customers. Glad so many appreciate art

The unique character of places

The canals of Amsterdam are a distinguishing characteristic of Amsterdam. But so are the swarms of bicycles on the city’s streets. Perhaps with a sense of humor, an in-room amenity of our hotel, The Pulitzer, was the bicycle repair kit.

A better understanding of the history of a place

We had never been to a concentration camp and had never heard of Terezin, outside of Prague. With our guide, we spent a morning at the camp. Although it only served as a way station to the extermination camps, many died of starvation and disease. Above its entrance, as in most Nazi camps, are the cruel words, “Work Makes Us Free,” which offered false hope.

Photo 12 camp entrance

On the wall of Terezin are poems written by children who were being held. One tells a poignant story:


A little garden
Fragrant and full of roses
The path is narrow
And a little boy walks along it

A little boy
Like that growing blossom
When the blossom comes to bloom
The little boy will be now more

Travel is many things……..

5 Ways To Boost Mental Health Now
From Sutter Health
The unrelenting demands of a busy life — our mental and emotional well-being can take a back seat to other concerns. Not only is mental health an important facet of our overall wellness — if left unaddressed, mental health issues can trigger other health problems, including diabetes, heart disease and stroke.
If you’re feeling stressed, overwhelmed or just want to enhance your emotional well-being, here are five simple things you can try right now to immediately uplift your mental health.
1. Step Outside (Porter Garden or sit on a bench on the front lawn)
Getting outside, can immediately shift your perspective, bump up your mood and give your mind a break.
Take a brisk walk through your neighborhood or head to a local park. If you can immerse yourself in nature, even better. Research has shown spending just 20 minutes interacting with nature can help lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol, lift mood and improve our ability to focus.
If you find yourself unable to make time, schedule it. Make your mental health a priority. Put a hold on your calendar for a short self-care break and get outside.
2. Find Gratitude (Donate to the Employee’s Fund, thank the garden committee or the Library Committee etc…)
No matter what’s happening in your life, practicing gratitude can help shift your focus away from negative thoughts. Stop what you’re doing right now and think of one thing, big or small, that brings you a feeling of gratitude. It takes just a few seconds.
Make it a habit: Studies have found that regularly expressing gratitude can decrease levels of stress over time, ease symptoms of depression and reduce anxiety. Before getting out of bed each morning, make a mental list of what you’re grateful for — people, experiences, things. Writing down your gratitude list can be even better because you can go back and review all the good in your life anytime you need a quick pick-me-up.
3. Talk to Someone (Chat with a Staff person you do not know well, visit with a new Resident etc…)
We’re social beings, neurologically wired for connection. Feeling isolated can intensify anxiety and stress. Social isolation is also associated with a greater risk of diseases such as dementia, heart disease and stroke. Feeling connected to others is good for our mental and physical health.
This connectedness is fostered through regular and meaningful interactions with people we care about, feeling supported by family, friends and community, and experiencing a sense of belonging. But in the short term, even a brief phone call can dial up your mood and sense of connection.
Facing a stressful situation? Reach out to a friend and ask them to be present with you. One study shows no matter how distressing the situation, having a friend by your side results in a lower spike of the stress hormone cortisol.
4. Get Moving (Walk in our garden, walk to the park at Fort Mason, walk around the block, walk to Chestnut street, exercise in our gym)
It’s proven that exercise can immediately transform our mood, reduce anxiety and depression, and improve our cognitive functioning. It’s all about the happy hormones, including dopamine and serotonin, that our bodies release when we exercise. Norepinephrine, which boosts alertness and attention, also increases during workouts.
Begin with simple movements to get your heart rate up ― even if you’re too busy for a full workout, make time for a few arm swings or a brisk 10-minute walk. Just enough to enjoy the release of your body’s natural feel-good chemicals.
5. Embrace Stillness (Meditate in the garden, listen to your favorite music)
Mindfulness is a non-judgmental awareness of the present moment. It can be a powerful tool to lower stress, enhance your mental functioning and improve mood.
Mindfulness can be practiced in a variety of ways, wherever you are, you can experience health benefits in less than a minute. Try a one-minute deep breathing exercise, a quiet meditation or a mindful walking meditation.


## Margaret Missiaen

Margaret (Nee Branham) finds it funny that her mother was considered a geriatric pregnancy at age 38, requiring her to go to Indianapolis to be close to an obstetrician. Her mother was a teacher in a very small rural school and took Margaret with her, actually being her teacher for 1st and 2nd grades.
Margaret graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington (60 miles from home) having majored in Political Science, and then went in to the Peace Corps where she spent two years (1964-1966) in Senegal. She worked in a mother-child clinic where the nurses were willing to teach her the necessary medical skills, but she felt totally incompetent and sought other avenues of service. Teaching language, reading and writing were not feasible because most of the women were totally illiterate. Instead she and a coworker taught the women to sew. Electricity was unreliable, but with a treadle sewing machine, the women were able to make their everyday clothing.
Margaret had studied French for three or four years at university, but,she said, "The well educated Senegalese who spoke French had very little tolerance for me trying to stumble through French, so I learned the local language which I loved."
In choosing a career, Margaret knew she had a strong interest in science, had received an award in biology, but in the 1950’s the options for women, particularly if not aggressive, were extremely limited. She also loved politics and was active in her university campaigns. She remembers with pride helping to elect the first African American president of the student body. She also was strongly influenced by President Kennedy, responding to the call to serve in the Peace Corps.
Home again after her service, not wanting to live in a small town, she went to Washington DC hoping to continue her interest in Africa. After a first job at the Library of Congress and continuing search, she landed a job in the Department of Agriculture with the title of agricultural economist, working with an ethnic anthropologist who wa doing a special study on identifying food preferences in African countries because the US was donating commodities that were not familiar to Africans. With multiple binders of every study that had been done on food preferences in Africa, and a report that was never issued, Margaret became an expert archivist, able to put her hands on any book that was required.
While living in Foggy Bottom in Washington DC, Margaret met her husband Ed, also an agricultural economist, and they found an apartment in Capitol Hill where the view from the bay windows was the back of the Supreme Court. This proximity to the Mall also gave her easy access to the protests she delighted taking part in.
In 1975 Margaret’s husband, who had been in the Peace Corps in Colombia, was assigned to the embassy in Brazil where Margaret enjoyed learning to speak Portuguese. Four years later they returned to Washington. Margaret retired in 1996 with 23 years of service.
Margaret has two sons; one lives a few blocks from here and the other with his family in Medford, Oregon. She has two granddaughters and two grandsons. Margaret and Ed had made prior plans to move to Heritage on the marina, but he died in January.
Margaret’s interest in growing things began in childhood when she spent her summers helping her mother grow vegetables and put food by for the winter. In Senegal she discovered that mint tea was the favorite drink and she maintained a patch of mint. She set up a garden again in Brazil and also when they returned to Washington.
When Margaret retired she volunteered at the US Botanic Garden and completed a certificate in in horticulture. We read on the internet that "She was widely known as the "Tree Lady of Capitol Hill", was awarded a 2010 Community Achievement Award largely for her devotion to pruning and nurturing neighborhood trees." Also: "We read about how Margaret Missiaen became a "guerrilla gardener" and so much more on Capitol Hill beginning in 1995. Some 20 years later, she put down her trowel and relocated to San Francisco." Helen Jackson, a nearby homeowner picked up that garden tool for a while and now places it in our hands. Guerrilla Gardeners of Washington DC is privileged to be the caretakers of this space and are naming it "Margaret's Garden" as a tribute to her legacy.
In San Francisco Margaret joined the Aquatic Park Senior Center which has a plot at the Fort Mason Community Garden. They were looking for a Caretaker for the garden plot and she said, “I was I was in the right place right time!”
Margaret and Ed were tireless in their contributions to their community. In 2007 Margaret and Ed were founding members of the Capitol Hill Village, a network of neighbors helping neighbors, where volunteers help older adults age comfortably in their own homes. Ed would do everything from changing light bulbs for folks to major projects.
Always adventurous, Margaret and Ed applied and were hired to be lighthouse keepers in Apostle Island National Lakeshore for one summer in northern Wisconsin. Living conditions were primitive but presented no problem because the skills they had developed camping and hiking all their married life made no plumbing and limited electricity no problem.
Margaret always appears ready for new things and is already engaged in many resident activities. You may find her in apartment 412P. Her phone number is (415) 515-8697; email – margaretmissiaen@gmail.com.
This is a bare bones description of Margaret’s life. For a more detailed interview with her done by the Capitol Hill History Project in 2010 go to:
