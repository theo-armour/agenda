icense looks
very good.
Good morning.
great news. So let's be clear.
As you know. If we get a third positive.
That's an outbreak. It shuts a lot of what we do now

Hello! Let us contest you.
And which is happening this time of year. I have a call on testing every day. Negative.
please, when you are out of your apartments because you
and likewise
if you're if you are in community, and you're wearing masks even say away from people. That's how you know the business thing is really what? What helps us the best. The masking, the distance in
exposure is considered 15 min, whether you're masked or unmasked in a 24 h period around first.
So so it doesn't take much to to get exposure. We're lucky that this recent positive person was very, very prudent and and and realized they needed to be so.
So
handing these next 2 tests, the party is gonna be on or off
our our director of like enrichment or community life, as we call her Karina has has been offered and taken a job
and I wanna read to you what she said. January.
this was a very difficult for me, but I decided to take a job closer to my home. I will greatly miss every one of you.
I'm currently working hard to ensure food and ambition. I wish you all the best going forward.
This is not the first time we knew, unfortunately, because we know that tremendous. That said
we didn't make an offer to our revenue health services. Director, new director of nurse for independent living. Her name is more than a coma that is not finalized yet, still working on that so we're hoping that we we don't go too long without them. One of them here.
Hard time. Definitely.
I also wanted to remind you that we really need to have review on file host
and a durable power of the current government. A pulse is a vegetable word for life, sustainable treatment. Sometimes we call it the living will
or a V. Nr, we need to know what you want something big and bad happen to you.
And a lot of you just didn't audit a lot of you do not have those under the charts.
And what happens if you don't have that listed on your chart, your dual power attorney, because you're probably not in a position to make a decision, something terrible just happening.
And what we also know is a lot of you don't have durable power of attorneys, so we will be contacting you and letting you know, if you need a durable power of attorney and or a pulse
and we're gonna help you to get those to us on your file. It just serves you best to have that and a lot of us here which I love being an advocacy program. Here we have. We have resident advocates for each other, I think, is like a fabulous program that we have.
But an advocate is not a dual power attorney and can't make those big decisions.
they can. They can do smaller things, but they can't make those like charming decisions.
I was asked by Margaret Davis to to discuss trends that are happening in our industry in 2024. And I'm going to go over this briefly, and I will take this up for Tato later.
But there are some major things happening in in senior housing and agent services across the country.
The biggest thing is we are in a workforce crisis.
And it's across the entire sector. It's across the entire
country, not just the healthcare sector, but the health care sector has been hit very hard.
So what are we doing about it? I mean California at a Federal level leading age, our member organizations working on immigration paths that are that are legal and increasing the number of visas, but allowable nurses. So we're working on those things. Another thing that that is is seen as a trend that's changing. Our industry is really working on our board of directors
to have them to be more effective at governance, not at operation, but at governance. So what does that really mean.
It means planning, understanding what our mission about what the organization is. And you know, we're all in the middle of this because we have a strategic plan. We're looking on because we know that there are limited resources for our organization.
And thinking of our risks as strategy and I remember organization meeting ages is melting a lot of tools forwards.
and what they're asking us. And instead of just creating a one year budget, we should create a 3 or 5 year budget.
We actually, with our Board Plan, have created a 10 year budget
as part of that strategic campaign. So I think we're a little bit, maybe ahead of that. But that's the time another big trend is home and community based services. What does that mean? Needs hospice phone help pay services.
Adult daycare. A lot of those are being developed. But the problem with them is they're not paid for by Medicare. And so what we're working on is funding for those through Medicare and Medical and Medicaid
and a lot of organizations break outwards, are partnering with those organizations as kind of a feeder source to keep senses up. So I thought that was a really interesting
opportunity that maybe we need to look at.
And there's changes in life plan, community like ours regulations at the State level.
we all know that we get California where we're doing this. There's a a recurring entrance fee. We used to be able to hold your entrance to you, have to be dive or moved out until your apartment was still, and now would like say, We can do that. But we have to. We have any interest on that, and you'll have a certain amount of time, and that's become a national
In some States.
When you get your monthly bills, your tax for your food and and we're working to get rid of that. You don't. We don't want that for residents. And this should come as no surprise. On a Federal level. They're working at tightening the regulations and assisted living
because many men really making sure
that we have the right care on the right services available to our residents in assisted living.
And then the last one of those like your trends is meant to support.
it's it's not that it's more stringent.
but it's smarter.
That is not paid for by medicare or metacount. That is considered a private pay.
But we're working on a Federal level trying to get Medicare to cover those services. So I think that I think a lot of those are really good use. Then another big trend and shouldn't be a surprise is artificial intelligence.
it's not our favorite remote monitoring
and tool and resources for for members like us.
And then the last thing and this is not new is diversity equity and
and they they stress that our Member organization at the State and National level is working with Hpc uses directly black colleges and universities.
To really try to pull more people of color into leadership in our organization.
in, in our industry. I'm sorry. They're developing a pilot fellowship program for black leaders, and they have developed a leadership of color network for mentorship and peer networking.
I think all of those are really good things to know that our Member organization is working on with us.
The list I wanted to talk to you about is the strategic plan. Many of you receive the Cpl Environmental
Inquiry report letter. It was a letter if you didn't get it. I don't know why, but many of you got the letter, but you didn't have a resident right into the city
about that and his public impact me to share with him. And exactly this meeting, I'll find emails. And from what you see, that
but the Resident who wrote it wrote in and on so
and so. They were very much against building a new building here. Because they thought it would be disruptive, and they thought it would be noisy and and not time in early years in life.
And those things are all true.
But the strategic planning committee of the Board of Directors have been working on 10 min about 10 years, and I've been. I've been part of it, for it's under 3 years.
The other choice to building while you live here is to move you all off campus to close essentially close.
not what you want. Right?
About 3 years ago we looked at this number 6 apartments available like apartments available in the city at like 20 communities.
So people know how to move.
proud of the city to the North Bay, East Bay, Down Peninsula, and lower, and and this is where you chose to be.
Move ahead with the idea instruction.
And, as I've told you, every single of this strategic plan has an offering which means the board and strategic stopping here. This is not what we need to do. This is not what we want to do.
and we're looking at important things all the time. And you heard me say this before, but I think it bears repeating.
make us financially sustainable on our own. But we never thought that what that was the only thing we would do. We also think, once we build, we'd be, must affiliate with another organization.
and that that would give us
the power of their corporate office and and their policy making and their resources and their leadership. You wouldn't need a CEO. Certainly here. Because you have another parent organization, and you would need probably an administrator or a double person here, you wouldn't need
construction partnership.
The other one that we've already done pieces of is outsourcing.
outsourcing some of our our departments.
so we get economies of scale. We did that with Morrison, and we did it with core works in the last year. and I really don't.
And II executed that decision with our team here, but that was the strategic plan system. And then the last piece is is just the everybody away.
And and and then take whatever money we get, and do a foundation with something else, and nobody wants to do that. So why are we at the let's still, let's really look at this. Why are we doing this?
We think it gives us the best opportunity to stay here
and to and to and affiliate with a larger company. We try several years ago, request for proposals. and we had 3 companies that we reached out to. Basically, they all said
operational.
And and the community is gonna want that 1 one buyer, some of that money? They were out of state and and we had to stop the affiliation process because the State of California says.
once you enter into an affiliation, you cannot close your nursing home for 5 years, and so so we did not go to a buyer anymore because they wanted to. They wanted to build right away. They would have sat on this for 5 years.
So we did that part now, and we're getting ready.
probably in the next year. Consider affiliation again as part of this. as you know, through land use permanent, and we think by the end of 2024. If things go as planned
with the land, use permit in hand.
we are a lot less likely to be desirable
partner. Because we've done a lot of that working, and we can show that the city, that kind of thing
and and partner that has money and economies of scale could help us. Then

Unknown Speaker
00:19:16
rope broke through and through this instruction
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:19:20
a lot of you ask, what happens when instruction would be nice, absolutely. Will it be messy absolutely. But what would we do?
I'm already trying to engage with senior
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
00:20:10
and and we will. We will let people
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:20:14
do that. We also will take many more bus trips that get you off of site and out of here during heavy construction times there will be tunneling walkways with roof over them courtyard would be turned down where we're standing would be gone, the the dining room would be gone. And so how do you connect these 2 buildings, there would have to be pathways.
So we're working on all of that and facing that. But one set of time. You have to get that lands permit. Once we get that permit by the end of 2,024, and we make a decision. We move forward
or do you stay. Now, let's try it earlier. I think that we're gonna probably vote to do both. So we'll get both of those things, so we'll get. Let's let's see what the affiliate partners look like.
And
I know that was a lot. I took up a lot of time, but I think immediately said, I think there's I think we get confused about what's happening. And and
and I totally understand fear that noise,
and and we also know. And we budgeted that some of the group would say, I want to be here.
We don't want that, but we understand that people decide to do that to. People have already left for that reason. And and it it may be that more will do so.
It's it's not what we want, but we understand that that may happen.
we all just leave it over for questions right now for me, if there are any. I know I spend a lot more time.
We talk a lot about a place that's and that's a trend in our community. We have a local community here who is actually
implementing that cause. II don't know any.
We're relatively near this in California. I'm working with a company called.
They're not.
That means Medicare
San Francisco Towers have their facility and built them every September.
but but we all know, and I have insight into the goal is to get rid of that nursing home and and make their agent in place moderate model
over at Samples Towers, where I wasn't Oberlin. We've been doing that for years.
We got caught in the you can't closure your
and more and more
so let me let me just take one step back, and our Rcmp. Residential care, facility for the elderly, which is the regulations for assisted living memory support.
and we we call it independently installed. Any of the companies really moving our partner across the street. Basically.
those regulations have no mention of nurses or doctors with therapists or rehab in that, because there's under Rca regulations, 0 medical model. There's no no nursing or medical people in there at all.
Answer for those Rcvs. If somebody gets sick is 9, 1 one that really is the model is that the health care model is 9 1 one. There's nobody there to take care of. The the people who pass
depends on your mentor at all. Yeah, thank you. So not even a nurse. But once you put a nurse
in your system living, and you do that 24 HA day. You start being able to age in place. And we have more than a nurse. We have a national director not met. We have 35 people and license people. We also have medical director. We also have plan for help. That gives us 24 h
telehealth and 24 h urgent care and the parentsite needle for their residents, but they will anyone for urgent care with.
We also have. We have physical, occupational, and and and speech therapy.
Those things allow us to work under the rcmp. Regulations in a situation called
an exception for a waiver. Because we have medical and nursing staff.
We have these waivers, and we, a waiver is for the whole building.
and we are working on
that's a waiver because it affects the whole building.
An exception is when let's pretend. And can I use you as an example? But that Charlie is unable to care for herself, and becomes bedroom.
But Tucker said, I want her to stay here with me. I don't want to move her into a nursing home.
I can get an exception on Charlie. It's an individual waiver. That says yes, you have enough nurse in here, but the medical barrier to support her in her home.
and if you recall, we had a survey in May. That was our our general survey for all of our Rcf. Efficiency.
but in that survey they also needed to request the 2 exceptions and one waiver. The waiter was to have a nurse practitioner be allowed to write orders without a position over time, and all 3 of those were granted to us without deficiency.
So so we are. We stand in it. We have good standing with the Department of Social services. In fact.

00:27:13
Grace Fernando, who is our
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:27:16
our Lpa or licensed weather and analysts?
I said.
but it really is the right way
actually doing it.
and give us some information on how it's working. And they're talking. Yeah, we are just like. you know, why we have to go there. Information.
I'm I'm concerned that you can certainly do that. I'm concerned that people think you're not gonna care here without process. So that if we have a community that is actually implemented in it, yeah, we could have some kind of Q&A with it.
And that's what I would say. Community everything from an Oakland. It would probably be a really good one. It's much larger community.
We could do that terms, but see the number of people age in place.
and then all the perimeter.
So you bring up the
so agent places a couple of things in our environment services
when you move out in your apartment in San Francisco, and you're not ready to come in here
nursing here, and
I'm in the end of March. You might have put it.
Who is our executive nurse? Question
right now? We don't even have that position. It's called a resident health service director and when Michael left we hired Linda
and and she's here 2 days a week with us, but she also remote 7 days a week, I mean, we're paying for
remote for us.
Her name is Linda hits, you see mercy
inscribe she
Jeff.
I don't think we have a start date yet
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
00:31:42
last Friday.
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:31:50
Sometimes they are like
Mary. Would it? Would it be possible to share Linda's phone number and email address?
I'll definitely share her email address. It's L is HIVP. S. At Heritage, Sforg.
And the the trick is, if you need Linda and ask the nurse
they actually didn't do them because they're on the phone for every day.
I see. Yeah.
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
00:32:56
hard to know.
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:32:58
I think I need to stop talking.
I I'm just wondering about them better. My understanding is that he has been all the coming first. Yeah.
And
as soon as we get now that we maybe offers and we're past that stage, and they're doing the employment.
the next one that I will be focusing. We are. When will that be
next week.
provided that we don't have a hiccup? What happens a lot of times is we're in the process of.
and they change their mind or decide they're not going to go to that employment. And then it gets we prioritize the top. And the reason for that is really important, all of you. We can't possibly prioritize everything.
those they will lose interest. They're willing to not look right and not being able to get to everybody. So we are doing our best to try to go ahead and really fill those nursing positions. First.
I have 2.
I found that question. I have commented
and changes the subject.
I was very happy to think that you're saying something about the segregating administration.
I've been here for a long time, best friend of mine.
and our admissions. Whatever
at the time said to me she was so giving up like change.
Profession integrated.
Yeah, something here agreed.
So basically in terms of diversity, you hire just based on applications and qualifications. What you'll start to see locally in the area is
am I missing something, though? Because the point is, we are living here, and these are services that we expected to be provided. And they're not being provided if you can hire them or not, hire them, or whatever
am I missing something? Am I saying it wrong? I'm not sure we're talking about there. I'm talking about everything we're missing here.
I can address
National Trend is there's a workforce crisis.
That's number one. Number 2 is we have one hr one
right now. We didn't have a second one last week. She she came in
for her own personal reasons, hasn't been so. We're we're recruiting for that as well.
So we have one person, and the priority has to be help here. That's what you're here for. and so
we. We hear you tell us all the time that when registry is here it doesn't work well.
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
00:37:43
and so our priority is to get our nursing staff
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:37:46
building as as best we can. It's not that we're not trying to get a driver, but when we have the ad sitting there and we're not interviewing them then lose candidates?
Because they think we're kind of lazy, or we're not doing our job. And and so right now we're open enrollment. Hr.
we have an employee investigation that's going on.
We have employee who believes. And there's a whole barrage of paperwork that has to go with that. We're recruiting for our nursing director, and that's a series of interviews. It's not that we're doing nothing. It's that we're doing the priority, which we believe is nothing right now.
That's good.
II never! I wish I had. I wish I had more resources. I just don't have several weeks ago.
But are we looking at. Why, so many of our employees? Really, it seems I've been here 4 and a half years.
We have a lot of people. Maybe so I'll I'll send to a few.
First of all, many Member people are hourly employees, and they'll leave renewal for a dime or nickel. That's number one to you.
A lot of our employees have been here a very long time, and they're leaving because they're simply
for ready to retire. Karina, for instance. She's not leaving for anything other than she. She got a job where she can be work. She, with her kids more and and closer to home, is not
not at all easy, and and tried to. Well, she did resign that.
and we were able to keep her. We were able to to entice her to stay and and keep her and this job it was just too good for her to to to stay and cause. We see that as such a huge loss. I mean, she she sort of is the blue that holds so much of of what we didn't have.
But yeah, it is a it is number one crisis affecting our industry right now, and it's affecting all workforce world.
I think the specific that hit me the hardest was for every person.
for every 5 people who are retiring in retiring and aging, leading the workforce. There is only one person joining the workforce. That's because the baby boomers were such. A. We're such a dense group of people, and there are fewer people in the generation that are coming into workforce right now.
So 5 people leave is one person 20 million dollar grant.
that is, is working on a Cna level, really working to train recruits cnas into our industry.
Because that seems to be the hardest for us. We get all the ends. We don't get our lens very easily in our industry. and I think there were
500 people in the last 3 months graduated that program about 12.
That's why I led with trends. That's why I led with.
what are what are we struggling with, because it's not just us, it is. It is really statewide and countrywide and worldwide.
please.
That truly did the poll on the workforce. We have not recovered from that.
And a lot of a lot of individuals, I mean not.
And so we are actually contributing. And then what are you looking at administrative divisions
prioritize.
because otherwise we're not going to get really anyone here. We try to do that previously of like doing kind of like the beginning of
looking at all these positions they're enjoying. And what happens a lot of the time is that pandemic will help out, even as you're going through entire classes the very end, whether it's pay or commute.
because a lot of the candidates thought we do that coming off the San Francisco. and in terms of like our staff is. I'm not really any particular individual
a lot of times it is because of Mary said. They are retiring.
or for health reasons, and then pay is another one. And I talked about this in smaller exciting standard. No.
we can't complete the hospital pay rate.
but what we provide here is a different experience. And so a lot of them are.
And so the pay also isn't gonna be at the hospital right now. you know, it is really important. That's what we're gonna do. They're gonna go and take that hospital reaping.
But those are the things that all part of recruitment. And we really are trying to do better in terms of.
They made me like when we went through that whole process.
In this process. So
kind of unfortunately, we have
a new town on the green.
So when I first came here we had mid taps. and some of them have nonstop status and happy power for the staff as a team, or whatever.
But
You have people who still our requesting, who were here as
user avatar
Unknown Speaker
00:46:03
unfortunately no.
user avatar
Theo Armour
00:46:15
So when we went to an agent in place model
and 24 7,
and we put an Lvm. On each ship. It indicates the need. Now.
what we did do. We save them all the Cnn take away page from them
nurses direction.
But
I think we need a little more. Yeah, remember that really quick updates on some other things going on so I don't know.
The corner is being landscape right now. We're trying to currently save the acacia tree that is in between the 2 lines was a
It was not a planted tree. It was one that was probably seeds dropped many years ago by a bird or something, and planted, or we want to keep it there for privacy, except right now, it is basically 2 trees growing apart in the center. And so the barber is on site right now.
See if they can save it, because either it's going to collapse on the building or it's gonna flap on the sidewalk, which we want none of that. So we're trying to save that right now. We didn't have the Center garden landscape with lawn and irrigated, but there is an issue at the today or yesterday. Maybe with the center garden looks like some of that press on. It pulled up. So I did reach out to the garden, basically what's going on there. But they are on site working on other stuff. So they had an issue that they'd have to double check or leak or something to that effect.
We are still moving forward to Morgan elevator project. We that's role in, you know, older development will production right now their development doors. They're producing ads. They're producing all the pictures. Everything is, gonna be kind of brass and kind with what the building has and kind of to to limit the impact of having a more modern system building.
We have found a
I'm hoping, a permanent solution for the door operator issues on Francisco and Octavia. So we've discussed them for that. As that elevator is crafting 2 different manufacturer control boards to work within our system instead of replacing the entire system that's there. So I'm really hopeful that that's going to be positive for both of my Cisco and Octavia residents.
Those 4 are really cumbersome, and we want to make sure those are limited. As with the marketing board, it's the same kind of issue.
I have a meeting as well to go over the fire panel. But we are having the fire panel workplace in 2024. The goal is no more. False. Alarm is is kind of. For for an example, it prints out it's alarm log
onto a Doc matrix printer from 1995. And so that printer is still chuckled away. We can barely buy paper for that back way. So it is. It's gonna be really nice to get that modernized. And get that out of the day and do.
We're also pushing forward with the new nurse call system. So I really wanted to take this moment to remind residents
in the event of an emergency, and there will be more information that goes out about this in a handbook which I'll bring up as well in the event of an emergency or the most immediate response.
Push your emergency pendant. Do not use the button on the wall.
The button on the wall is a good way to communicate, but that requires somebody to actually be standing next to that console
or an actual emergency pressure candidate that you wear around the neck or risk, and that will contact the nurses wherever they are, not, just when they're in headers and plan. And it also gets location. And it's got that location. It's got a zone location on it. So we have an idea to where you are
as we move into 2024 with the new Nurse Hall system, those wall buttons that you have will be replaced, and then, and they will communicate with the main system and be able to be used in the event of emergence. So just add them up on that
user pending for an emergency that might not be a help emergency, either. That mean. Finally, I'm trapped in the elevator, or I'm standing next to a giant. The best way to get response from staff in an emergency of any kind is to press that pendant. But you have to be wearing it, please.
Ph. Personal.
This will kind of go on to the next thing.
Mary and I have been working diligently to upgrade and get you a modern resident handbook.
We are almost at the end of it. Mary's not a lot of work or input. This is our way to kind of caught by policies, procedures, departments, services, everything like that, you know. Additional housekeeping go down once the birthday thing with locations of things in the building, but it also talks about things like the personal help button.
You know, it's got a list of numbers. And all this. So it's about 40 pages right now, and we're we're really hopeful that this will be a really good handbook for residents to know kind of the operation we hold to have that out. But that could be a really good update for that. And then one of the just one thing I wanted to remind everybody kind of. Lastly, and I'll have a lot more information in January for the interest in time
a lot of you guys have items that you receive in the mail that are maybe bills or something like that that actually needs to go to the accounting department or the nursing department here in Marina.
And you're really good about dropping that off at the accounting department. What we've been really bad at is telling you that that mail must be opened. We cannot open your private mail. So you get something from accounting and needs to go accounting. All you gotta do is just pop it open and give it to the front office and tell them for accounting. Fortunately, if we get a piece of mail that is unopened, we will bring it back to you and have you open it, and then we can take it from there because it's considered misappropriation of press and property. You have all your
right. So I actually wanted to receive on open correspondence. And so that's one of those issues where we cannot open. So this as an aside, if you ever get a piece of mail back in license. Please open on there, just pop it open, and some might have to be your bring to the office, and it's sealed, and we say, Open up organ. But it's just while we really try to make sure that we're respecting your privacy.
And and maybe you know, maybe that mail actually wasn't something that you needed to give us. And now we're in your business. So that is all for the quick updates for me, I'll have more kind of. But we can definitely yeah, John's on that zoom.
Or
I wanna thank you for the collective opening of the door on Francisco. Just like the elevator.
It's it's not done so that that's not the final. Yeah. So
right here, there is no automatic opener on this. No, that. No, it's that button just unlocks. There is no automatic opener actually pushing the door open.
I know
I have apple product to replace that.
So that's fine. That's fine.
As soon as, like the last few people are tested. So 4 of 6 people are negative.
Yeah.
I'm sorry I have a quick announcement, too. I'm sorry I have to leave, but I was asked to look at the the taxation issue, based on the fact that they still
what we're going to have
first come first
in the dining room. Another announcement made after about 8 and a half years, our executive chef. Kevin had an opportunity to
supporting community that's closer to the East Bay. He's been traveling to the east from the East Bay here every day. So he has an opportunity to support a community, and that he stays there. Very. We have a very, very strong candidate. We just want to make it official before I announce with it. There will be no left in your food
experience.
We want to meet young fish. We want to get official before we announce it.
And that New Year's
celebration. We'll see how that works with other communities.
John, take it away
alright. Just 2 quick things. Tomorrow is a a financial strategy meeting in the morning to go over the third quarter financials. And then I've been working on the tax question on this that's been asked.
It is a 5 year. Look back, period. So we will be looking at years 2018 to 2022, which includes the skill nursing. So there's no significant change in the amount of the tax deduction for your 2023 taxes
for those type, a contracts that it applies to.
But then, John, over the next 4 years, as we lose a year each year we're gonna get further away from that.
Well, what I've been working with the auditor on is saying, Okay, wait a minute. We're reducing the expense. And you know, an increasing, you know. Cost are those are those gonna offset each other as it trickles off. So right there's less
healthcare center expense. But then there's less total operating expense. So I'm not sure how much that percentage will change. We're looking at a projection once we have a full year of financials right? So in in this year, in 2023, it's kind of a funky year, because the first quarter still have the skilled nursing facility. Open it 2024, the first clean year where all we have is aging in place with uses to live in one.
So we need to look at those numbers once we get into 2024. But again, if they offset each other, going, going, trickling, going forward. I don't see there's going to be a huge offset to the, you know. Change to those numbers, it'll it'll decrease, but not. I don't think it's going to be as big a decrease, as we would initially thought
so. But the good news is at least for the letters. For 2023 tax year. It's a 5 year. Look back, and since the skill was still open in 2022, we plugged in those numbers, and we don't see any significant increase in the offer. Confirm this morning. It's still going to be just over 19,000. Which is the deduction.
If Fred had asked if you could speak to say Harper to explain to everyone to save Harbor.
Well, safe harbor is is just the amount of money that goes. You mean the 400, and that's the safe harbor. I don't think that has anything to do with that? Yeah, he's just he's asked for it to be explained.
Yeah, I'm not sure why he would know that I'll reach out to him separately and find out what he.
