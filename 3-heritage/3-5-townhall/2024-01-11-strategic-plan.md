Randy ~ vice chair ~ chair strategic plan committee

Past: slight deficit ~ kitche for 100 peeps ~ small gifts UCSF

Over time: expenses greater than fees

fees not raised enough


## Mary

crocker closed because of lawsuit

50's retirement communities ~ not designed for the elderly

3 rcfe in SF not or profit ????

Rest are for profit

Exp double rev

Would like at break-even, but drawing on portfolio

even 100$ occupancy: $4.5M deficit

Double SF: have permits, plan = leverage
Affiliation: not yet enough value ~ right partner  overhead support
Out source departments: food, housekeeping, maintenance
Consider Management company

Affiliate: wants our money

Outsource: savings

Outsource management: charge a percent of revenue

City like the idea / Stefani likes the idea

RFP affiliates ~ better because SNF closed and no 5 year morotorium

coreworks is cheaper

monagement company: talking now
