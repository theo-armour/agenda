# 2023-11-16 Fire System Panel Instructions

Compiled by Theo Armour

The following is a copy of the text of a document currently posted on the Heritage fire system panel next to the Front Office.

Some observations

* I have no idea what half this stuff means
* I have no idea if this is still current
* I have no idea about the locations mentioned
* I see no mention of informing residents of a false or real alarm
* I see no mention of how to use the loudspeaker system
