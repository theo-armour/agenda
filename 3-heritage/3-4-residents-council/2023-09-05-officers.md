Hi Patrick, Martha, Paula and Tony


Meeting with Jeff
Recently Patrick and I met with Jeff. At the next town hall meeting we asked him to

* Explain and inform residents about the recycling service being used
* Explain to residents that they should have no fear of being homeless or having to look for new homes
* Provide updates on door to Francisco Street entrance
* Provide update on magnetic retainers for Health Center/Assisted Living door

We also asked if he could help us persuade Kathy Kirkpatrick to help form or advise a building committee

Another door idea
Update the lock to the cottage so that it can be opened with the regular resident entrance key. This would allow residents to use the cottage without having to go to the front office.

Employee Appreciation Fund
It's coming up to that time of the year. The October Heritage Happenings will include a reminder.

New residents often ask about how much to give. In order to help them I would like to ask Jon Casey as to the average amount given by residents as well as the high and low gifts.

Patrick: Any updates?
