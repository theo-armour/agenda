Randy

Thank you very much for your excellent overview of the history of the Strategic Plan. I had little idea of its length and complexity.

A couple statements you made caught my attention:

The first is that you suggested that the small suites (as they currently priced) are loss making leaders. I was surprised that they bring in less per square foot than the larger units. I will be the first to admit that the suites are a great bargain. $4K for my lifestyles is a great deal - and it enables me to give away more money.

The other statement you made was more interesting: the notion that the portfolio might last as long as fifteen years. Also there was no mention of what would happen to residents if the portfolio were to be be reduced to zero.

I am looking at Appendix H in the 2019 version of the type C Continuing Care Contract.

The title is summary of procedures in the event of CCRC closure. The text refers to California Department of Social Services Code sections 1793.80 through 1793.83

I attach a copy of the code sections. Here is a link: https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=HSC&division=2.&title=&part=&chapter=10.&article=9.

To summarize: In the event of closure, the code requires the CCRC to provide a plan for the transfer of residents to other facilities offering comparable care and services at no additional cost to the resident.

This indicates to me that the DSS would demand that a closure plan be activated well before the portfolio is reduced to zero so as to fave the ability to fund the closure adequately.

I have difficulty imagining the cost of such a transfer. Off the top of my head, for continuing care residents, it might be two or three times the cost of the current prices of entrance fees for a resident's apartment. For life care residents, it might be three to six times the cost of the current entrance fee the resident's apartment. The overheads for managing such a transfer would be high - finding the resources to locate comparable facilities, negotiating with them, and then moving residents would be a huge undertaking - likely costing several million. Looking at low end numbers: 70 residents at $300K each is $21M.

It seems to me that the closing bell starts ringing not in 15 years, but more like five to ten years.

I would be interested in your thoughts.
