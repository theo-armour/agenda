> The construction of Late Gothic architecture in the Americas dates almost to the moment of European arrival. In 1496, the brother of Christopher Columbus, Bartolomé, established the first Spanish colonial city in the hemisphere, Santo Domingo, on the southern shore of an island which the conquerors named Hispaniola or Española (now comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic). In this colonial urban landscape, churches, convents, private houses and civic buildings co-opted elements of the Gothic style, such as quadripartite and stellar ribbed vaults,Footnote1 tripartite windows, tracery and ogive arches.Footnote2 Based on the colonial situation, including the Spanish encounter with Amerindians and desires to extract material wealth from the new lands, Gothic forms in early Santo Domingo provided a sense of cosmopolitan sophistication and religious sanctity on a frontier relatively unknown to Europeans. Such forms also assisted in the assertion of Spanish colonial rule, the presence of the Church and aristocratic claims to property and new wealth. In Spain, it could be said that Gothic was the inheritance, refinement and innovation of medieval forms in use for centuries on the peninsula and abroad, and was at the time of Columbus’ fateful journey in 1492 a visual idiom strongly favored at the court of Spanish Queen Isabella I. In the early days of Spanish conquest in the Caribbean and on the American mainland, Gothic forms came into frequent use, often synthesized with Italian classicism and Islamic styles in Spain.
