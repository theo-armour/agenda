Hi 

Invitation to join the Heritage Residents Mailing List

Would you kindly allow me to add your email address to the Heritage residents email mailing list?

The Residents Council officers will be using this mailing list to inform all the residents with email of any significant news items. It will replace Bernie's private email group.

My guess is that there will be one or two emails a week - at the most.

If you agree, I will add your address. You will then receive an email notice that your address has been added to the list. You need do nothing other than replying to this message with a "Yes".

If there are any issues, I am here to make sure that they are resolved to your satisfaction. If you have questions, we can meet and have a chat.

Theo
