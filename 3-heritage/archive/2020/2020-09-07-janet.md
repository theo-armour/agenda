I keep a list of cool things I discover about life at the Heritage. It gets longer and longer. Here are three over-arching thoughts:

* Apartment 227 - which you picked for me - suits me to a T
* Staff and resident relations are of the highest standard
* The recent 100% negative COVID-19 test results is a testament to effective management

Here  is what I am telling people these days:

* Given my evil past, the Heritage is as close to heaven as I may ever get.
