Breakfast time in the dining room. Fat old man sitting in wheel chair eating bacon and eggs. I ask if I may join him. He assents; I sit. And listen for an hour.

Al Johnson

Been here ten years. Likes it here. Spends his afternoons recording the memoirs of his life. Has 500 hours now.

He wrote the standard textbook on medical ethics. In the mornings he is editing the eight edition.

Another guy can over. It turns out the two men have a word of the day game. Yesterday's word was so complicated, I can't rember it - something about tergiversation - or "turning your back" in Latin.

Al was born in 1921.

Hi everyone

2020-02-19: OMG ~ file in category of kittens ~ ponies ~ donuts ~ and wonderful things

I am sitting in the cafe of the hostel at the top of Fort Mason. Looking out the window I see from the GG Bridge to Berkeley while overlooking the mustard flowers in bloom and peeps on bikes.

The WiFi connection is fast, the coffee is good, the barista tres sympa. It took me 20 minutes walking up hill to get here from the Heritage, probably 15 minutes to get back.

What I like: this place is a total treasure and it's almost empty.

Various thoughts from two of my favorite authors resonate quit visibly as I walk around the Heritage and its grounds.


[Jane Jacobs]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs ) author of [_The Death and Life of Great American Cities_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_and_Life_of_Great_American_Cities ) in 1961 said:

> “A city street equipped to handle strangers, and to make a safety asset, in itself, our of the presence of strangers, as the streets of successful city neighborhoods always do, must have three main qualities:

> First, there must be a clear demarcation between what is public space and what is private space. Public and private spaces cannot ooze into each other as they do typically in suburban settings or in projects.

> Second, there must be eyes upon the street, eyes belonging to those we might call the natural proprietors of the street. The buildings on a street equipped to handle strangers and to insure the safety of both residents and strangers, must be oriented to the street. They cannot turn their backs or blank sides on it and leave it blind.

> And third, the sidewalk must have users on it fairly continuously, both to add to the number of effective eyes on the street and to induce the people in buildings along the street to watch the sidewalks in sufficient numbers. Nobody enjoys sitting on a stoop or looking out a window at an empty street. Almost nobody does such a thing. Large numbers of people entertain themselves, off and on, by watching street activity.”

[Christopher Alexander]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander ) author of [_A Pattern Language_]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language ) in 1970 said:

> 159 LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM

> When they have a choice, people will always gravitate to those rooms which have light on two sides, and leave the rooms which are lit only from one side unused and empty.

> Therefore:

> Locate each room so that it has outdoor space outside it on at least two sides, and then place windows in these outdoor walls so that natural light falls into every room from more than one direction.
