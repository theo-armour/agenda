# 2022-08-05 RC July notes

Hello HotM residents and staff

Kindly find attached:

* The notes for the July meeting of the Heritage on the Marina Residents Council
* The new Bylaws of the Heritage on the Marina Residents Council

The notes continue to develop the mission of delivering aging-friendly news and reports

You may notice two notable aspects of this month's notes:

* The graphic design of the Notes closely follows that of the Heritage Happenings. The body text is presented with a typeface that is considered open and legible - suitable for people with vision issues. The headline typeface is considered to be warm and friendly. For example, it is a typeface often used on the toy blocks that small children play with.
* The content is primarily minimally edited notes prepared by the speakers - along with snippets of the dialog speakers actually uttered at the meeting. The goal is to help you feel that you attended the meeting even if your were not there.

I hope the effort pleases you,

Theo Armour
Secretary Heritage on the Marina (HotM) Residents Council
