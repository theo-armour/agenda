### 2020-10-17 / 2021-08-09 / Invite

This message is simply to inform you that I have added to your name to an email list for Heritage residents.

You don't need to do anything

The goal of this project is to encourage online dialog and camaraderie even when we are physically couped up in our apartments.

I will follow up with a message emails that describes all of this in more detail. In the meantime, sit tight and wait for nice things to happen,

If you have questions or want to know more or want to help - just let me know.

Theo

Gardner will be released form Quarantine on Wednesday. The four residents under observation over last weekend all tested negative. If we all test negative (again) next week the dining room will likely reopen and we will be permitted to have visitors

If you have some good news about life at the Heritage, kindly email this address residents@ heritage.groups.io. Your message will be copied to all 59 residents that have email addresses.

Or you can drop by, phone or massage me and I will spread the news. There are people hee who are being affected by isolation and loneliness. Please send out some warmth and hope.
