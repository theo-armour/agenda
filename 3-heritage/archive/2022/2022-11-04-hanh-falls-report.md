Hi Hanh

Would it be possible for you to schedule a meeting with me next week?

I would like to hear about two things:
The lessons that were learned regarding the two injuries that occurred while residents boarded the bus for the recent excursion to Samuel P Taylor Park.
The procedures that may be put in place to help prevent such incidents from occurring in the future

## Lessons learned

* Trained staff must be present upon boarding people with walkers or other assistive devices
* Climbing steps should be one person at a time
* Residents should be warned if there are issues with handrails
* Untrained staff may hurt more than they help
* Care Givers are not CNAs

## Checklist

* CNA to check bus stairs for safety considerations prior to residents boarding
* CNA to be present at curb when residents embarking or disembarking from Francisco
* If no CNA is present on the bus, the driver should be ??? to work with residents with issues
* All staff to be trained on how to react when they com across an injured resident - call for help first, make resident comfortable but do not move
* All staff to have card with emergency number
* All staff with phones to have icon on their phone that they can direct dial Health Center
