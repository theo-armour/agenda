# 2022-09-29Library Committee


Dear Library Committee members

I am once again preparing and editing an issue of the Heritage Happenings. For the past few months the "Library Corner" contribution has consisted of lists of new books, a list of library usage guidelines and the names and email addresses of all the Library Committee members.

I note, however, that the distribution list for the newsletter is increasing:

Heritage Happenings is used as a marketing tool to attract new residents
Digital issues are available via the TouchTown app
Issues are sent to selected family and friends

Because of this I am loathe to continuing the practice of including your names and email addresses in every issue. While being friendly and intimate, this practice may also expose committee members to having their identities harvested by spammers and other naughty people.

I would like to propose an alternative communication channel. As most of you know, I maintain the Heritage residents mailing list. It would simple for me to create a new email address such as: library@heritage.groups.io.

Any message sent to that email address would automatically be forwarded to all committee members who wish to be on the list.

I have discussed this idea with Gene, Kay, Yvonne and Margaret Johnson - and they are all onboard.

Judith and Pamela: I would be pleased to hear your thoughts before creating the address and including it in the October issue.

Theo
