# House Committee: 2022-10-18

Message from Eleanor Bissell

In response to residents' concerns about the everyday appearance of our Heritage home, I volunteered to compile and email their concerns.

Thw following is the list of items that need work that I requested followed by responses from Mary and Oleg.

## Perry Elevator

_**Eleanor:**_
Number 1 on everyone's list: Please replace the tatty bench in the Perry elevator. The bench is used by residents who need a place to sit while on the elevator. The 'Bench' is the first thing residents, visitors and potential residents see when entering the elevator "Disgraceful" etc. An easy fix and everyone is watching

_**Mary:**_

_This is in process. And for Morgan elevator. We are still getting the right fabric samples so it can be wiped down._

## Morgan Elevator

_**Eleanor:**_

Interior of Morgan elevator needs to be cleaned and painted. Doors and shaft need cleaning. See Tony for details.

_**Mary:**_

This is part of our capital budget for this year.  May extend into 2023 as there have been permit issues with this project.

## Morgan Female Restroom

_**Eleanor:**_

Peeling wallpaper in powder room.

_**Mary:**_

Putting on capital budget for next year.

## Morgan Parlor

_**Eleanor:**_

Chandeliers and sconces in Morgan Parlor need to be cleaned.

_**Mary:**_

I’ll work on this.

## Windows

_**Eleanor:**_

Windows need to be washed more than every 6 months.

_**Mary:**_

I will try to get this budgeted.

## Van and Taxi Services

_**Eleanor:**_

Being without van service has been a hardship. Taxi service is unreliable, time consuming and drivers are not responsive to needs of residents getting in and out of the cab. Transportation is part of the services offered to residents. Taxis are not the answer. Please never again!!

_**Mary:**_

_I so agree.  However, the employment market in the COVID arena has made it impossible to hire.  We have actively tried to get a driver.  None existed to our knowledge.  I know this is an extreme hardship for residents so we worked hard to get someone to drive.  We simply could not find a driver._

## Perry Kitchens

_**Eleanor:**_

Second and fourth floor Perry kitchens are without cutlery. Fourth floor Perry blinds are not functioning well. Janet Howell was our 'go to' person. Could Patti and Melissa meet with resident groups on each floor to hear what else is needed? Lots of requests for wall art? It would be helpful to have sitting room carpets cleaned on a regular basis.

_**Mary:**_

_This could possibly be Melissa. I’d rather those issues come to me.  I will assign them.  I will purchase cutlery today._

## Key Access

_**Eleanor:**_

A number of residents are having difficulty inserting their key and opening the door to their apartments. Suggestion is to have maintenance apply WD-40 to each door lock.

_**Mary:**_

_I’ll get this in a work request today._


## McGinley Room

_**Eleanor:**_

Is it possible to have a fan or air coolers like the ones in the dining room, for McGinley Room?

_**Oleg:**_

_We will add an air purifier to the McGinley room like we have in other common areas of the campus._

_This should be installed by tomorrow, pending vendor delivery._

_**Eleanor:**_

This is a beginning of an important dialogue between management who can take action on the concerns expressed by residents and residents who need to be heard.

I am not able to take the lead on this project. Theo will keep the correspondence going. Hopefully volunteers will step forward
to form a group to carry on.
