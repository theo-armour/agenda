# Recap: Mary Linde's talks on Validation Therapy

Heritage on the Marina CEO, Mary Linde  along wit Hanh Ta and Praveen presented a theatrical characvterizetion of cognitive decline and dementia. For many residents it was a reenactment of events we experience regularly yet reinterpreted with a deep and relevant back story.

For example when we hear a resident saying "I want to go home", we typically respond with words such as "you are home. You sold your house. This is where you live". Nonetheless the resident may get even more upset because where the resident is now doe not look like the home that they remember in their brain and you do not want to help them go to that home.

Even a relatively new resident at the Heritage, I have witnessed and participated in similar interactions with residents on numerous occasions. Mary's presentation offered methods recasting of these scenarios that can result in more positive outcomes.

Validation Therapy
Developed in the 1960’s and 1970’s by Naomi Feil, with Validation Therapy the focus is on **empathy** and **listening**. The goal is to provide a means for those with dementia to communicate and to work to resolve unfinished business

* Validate underlying feelings
* Join the agenda
* Redirect the conversation


Recasting our scenario, when a resident says "I want to go home", you might express empathy by saying "you must really miss your home" If the resident replied "I really do", you might ask "What do you miss the most?". If the responds with words such as "I miss cooking in my kitchen" then you know that your succeeded in redirecting the conversation
