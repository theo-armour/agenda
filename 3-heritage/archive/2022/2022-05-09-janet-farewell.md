In the spring of 2020, at the height of the first and most scary wave of the COVID19 pandemic, I messaged Janet requesting to be accepted as a resident of Heritage on the Marina. There were evidence-based justifications that influenced my move to a safer, more sociable, higher quality lifestyle than where I was living at that time:

* Not-for-profit with money in the bank
* Three levels of care
* Compared well with facilities I had visited in Oakland, Reno, Santa Barbara and San Francisco
* Ranked well in in spreadsheets I built to gauge factors including location, price, walkability, beauty, security and more
* Provided delight when, courtesy of Eleanor and Bernie Burke, I had spent three days as a resident in Heritage's guestroom

Nonetheless, even with all these points of confidence, I would never have moved to Heritage without particular confidence in Heritage management. I felt that Bernie Burke and his son-in-law were doing a good job at board level. At day-to-day staff level, I had only one primary point of contact: Janet. If I did not have complete confidence in Janet then I would not have signed up.

I have confidence in Janet because she is:
* Future-oriented ~ looks to the future and not the past for inspiration
* Managerial ~ has the voice, vocabulary, dress of a person comfortable in the executive suite of a large organization
* Design-oriented ~ renovates apartments to have a contemporary look and feel
* Genuine ~ her office is just as modern and tech-enabled as her other projects
* A communicator ~ makes effective use of email; agile with her tele-presence & web-presence

So it with a ton of gratitude that the confidence I placed in you now provides me with a life of few worries and much pleasure. That you encouraged me to move to an apartment that gives me ongoing sociability is icing on the cake.

Thank you, Janet
