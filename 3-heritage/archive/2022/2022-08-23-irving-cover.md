Hello Heritage residents

Today was our activities coordinator, Irving Carillo's last day at Heritage. After his first trip to Europe, he will start training at the Sonoma County Fire Academy on September 12.

During the long dark days of Covid isolation, Irving brought us a touch of joy. He was our Heritage Santa Claus in 2020. And - before and after - always a happy spirit in our midst.

A message board for messages of farewell and thanks has been started for Irving.

I will copy the messages many of you wrote on the card on the table by the dining room.

But if you did not get a chance to add your good wishes to the card, please feel free to send me an email with your message for Irving or add your good thoughts or photos directly!

All the messages and photos will be collected and printed as a book to remind Irving of the friendhsips he created with so many of us here.
