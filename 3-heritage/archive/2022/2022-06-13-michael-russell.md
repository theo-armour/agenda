Hi Michael

In the June issue of Heritage Happenings, you are quoted by Martha Nell ss saying:

“We want to make sure we live in a community we’re proud
of and that the city will be thankful for. Heritage is well positioned to be a
Pillar of Wellness in the community.”

Do you have any good links, references or sources for the "pillars of wellness" concept?
