**Objective**

**\* Intiial reason was Tony baiting Mary so hard that she left the meeting**

**\* One of the residents reported: "As he left the building she said 'I'm never coming back here again"**

\*\*Situation calmed don, but still feel that a talk would be helpful  
\*\*

### Preface

*   Personal life: All good: Family, location, fitness, diet, sleep, social, mental, spiritual, financial
*   Heritage life #1: I'm having a great time, a ton of fun, and learning a lot
*   Heritage life #2: There are issues
*   Personality conflicts
*   Mis-communication
*   less than perfect: health services and maintenance

### Residents

*   Extremely aged cohort, cannot rely on for anything
*   Unprepared for change, very concerned, some stressed
*   Minimal understanding or comprehension of the Strategic Plan
*   Serious contingent of anti-Mary residents
*   Sadly: most residents have little or no concept that they are part of a 170-year charitable legacy

### Directors

*   Overworked, under supported
*   Mary: speaks too fast, not touchy-feely
*   Jeff: over promises, under delivers
*   Karina: not enough time, not enough support
*   Jon: MIA
*   Praveen: ??
*   All smart, hearts in good places

### Services & Staff

*   Dining, Housekeeping, Maintenance: 5 stars
*   Health Services, Activities, Accounting: ??

### Process & Procedures

*   Appear to be almost non-existent
*   Writing and keeping records is not part fo the skillset
*   No one knows what is going on
*   Of course, there are a ton of forms to submit to agencies

### Observations

*   There are a ton of issues
*   Staff, facilities, health services, accounting, IT, communications, emergency management, etc.

### Possibilities

*   Join with larger organization
*   Employ a touchy-feely person

### Questions

*   What can I do to help?
*   How can I be good eyes and ears for the Board
