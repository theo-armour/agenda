Hi Mary

Regarding the upcoming revamp of the Residents Council meeting, I am in full agreement with Patrick's 10 points in his message "Details of the committee meeting June 15 sent to Mary" sent on June 20 and his proposed agenda of June 25 - which I believe he copied to you.

I would like to add the two following action items:

* Residents Council meetings are conducted in a manner that is friendly to the cognitively, visually and aurally impaired.

In my experience as Secretary, we have been failing to do this. After meetings I hear things like the following:

* I could not attend the meeting, but I want to know what happened
* I could not hear what was said, but I want to know what was said
* I want to know what was said, but I am not able to listen to a recording

A second aspect of recent Residents Council meetings is that in recent times the meetings are discussion settings and while there many topics of interest few if any actions items are generated.

The dilemma is that when residents other than myself take the notes that little of interest is recorded and the notes of meetings are as useful as burnt toast. On the other hand, when I take the notes they tend to include the kitchen sink. Neither route is satisfactory. Neither route has produced significant deliverable action items.

* Residents Council meetings take advantage of modern technology. Using Zoom or similar apps all meetings are recorded, transcribed and summarized. Recordings and summaries are made available to residents, staff, BoD and other interested parties.
