# Residents Council Meeting Revitalization

## Problems with Recent Residents Council Meeting.

* Residents Council meetings are too long
* No prepared agendas notes are sent out
* No prepared slides are displayed
* No action items are called for during the meeting
* Residents are not fully-engaged in the meeting
* Little or no resident-to-resident interaction occurred

Let's work on fixing these issues!

## Suggestions

A good thing might be to propose a new format for the Residents Council (RC) meetings

### Revamp the Meeting Time and Format

* Future Residents Council meetings shall be limited to one hour or less
* Staff talks should be limited to a total talk time of 30 minutes
* At the end of the 30 minutes, the staff should be allowed to return to their normal duties
* The remaining portion of the RC meeting is used for resident-to-resident interaction

### Improve the comprehension by residents/ Simplify Documentation Preparation

* Staff shall prepare and send out a PowerPoint (online slide document) prior to the meeting
* Slides will be displayed during the meeting
* Text of slides shall readable by slightly visually impaired residents sitting at the maximum distance from the screen
* Notes of Meetings shall be based on the slides
* Off-the-cuff remarks will only be noted upon requests of the speakers
* Relevant Q&A may be noted

Implement Moderation

* The resident portion of the RC meeting shall have an agenda and
* The resident portion of the RC meeting shall be moderated
* An objective of the RC meeting shall be to agree well-formed actions items
* Action items will be determined by residents and forwarded to staff by email for discussion and implementation

Leverage Technology

* Resident council meetings shall be recorded shared (live?) via Zoom or similar,
* The audio shall transcribed, summarized by AI and made available to staff and residents
* Exploration of modern meeting management technology and techniques shall be encouraged
