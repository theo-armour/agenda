Meal Tray Disposal

Here are two photos taken Friday evening of the Morgan third floor lounge.


You will note the piles of trashed completed dinner service. This is evidence of the lack of a policy for disposal for meals delivered to apartments when residents are ill and are having their meals delivered to their apartments.

I note that Yvonne, Gene and I have disposed of meals delivered to Carm on a number of occasions. Meals delivered to Erika have sat outside her door overnight on a number of occasions. (I am not able to pick up a tray off the ground without a lot of effort, so I leave them there. )

Apparently there is no current policy for staff to pick up the meal trays after meals have been consumed. Eventually, the trays are picked up by someone, but this does not happen in a timely manner - and thus is not conducive to proper pest control.

There can we agree a policy? I suggest like the following:

Meal Tray Disposal Policy Suggestions

After you have eaten your meal, please contact the Dining Room and ask them to pick up your tray.

If a resident is unable to do this, a member of staff may be assigned to monitor the resident and arrange for disposal at the appropriate moment.

Alternatively, a the team member that delivers the meal might agree with the resident a pickup time for retrieving the tray.
