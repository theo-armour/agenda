# 2023-06-26 Fire Alarm Protocol

An almost unavoidable consequence of communal living is the occasional disturbance of a blaring fire alarm.

For the most part actual fires have been of little consequence. Most of the incidents have been false alarms. Nonetheless the alarm signal is highly stressful and highly annoying.

There is, however a particular circumstance with false alarms that is worth addressing.In order to comply with local fire regulations, a fire alarm on the premises may only be stopped by an officer of the fire department. Heritage staff are not permitted to turn off alarms.

On-site Heritage staff may know within a few minutes that an alarm was false. Typically, alarms are caused by a faulty circuit in the alarm system. Heritage staff must, however, wait until the fire engines arrive and let the firefighters into the building.

In the meantime, in recent events, residents have not been informed in a prompt that the alarm was false. Residents, particularly Assisted Living and IL+ residents, who are waiting in place may become increasingly distressed at not knowing the current status of their safety.

Even though the falsity of the alarm may be revealed to staff in a few minutes, residents may be stressed for the entire length of the many minutes it takes for the alarm to be turned off.

## Recommendation to implement an improved fire alarm response protocol

The Heritage Safety Officer <title?> on duty, as and when they are satisfied that an alarm is false and as soon as practicable shall announce over the in-house loudspeaker system that the alarm is false - or shall otherwise inform residents of the current status of the incident.

The outcome is that in the event of an alarm that after the discovery of a false alarm has been made that residents may continue to be annoyed by the noise of the alarm but they no longer need to be distressed by the alarm of the alarm.

At every instance of a fire alarm test or inspection, the Heritage Safety Officer shall also use the in-house loudspeaker to deliver notice to residents and thus to demonstrate their ability to operate the system.

Reminder instructions shall be posted near the fire alarm control panel.
