Hi Roxana

Attached please find an updated Daily Life Enrichment Calendar

Updates include:

Margins have been reduced to give more space for larger text
Text and images in the table is set to always be centered vertically and horizontally
The default or "normal" style font is 22 pt Verdana bold.
The font has a touch of "red brick" color to add a warmer touch
Vertical internal borders have been deleted so as not to interfere with the text
Images have been set to be "In Line With Text" so that they can be moved around more easily

There should be enough space to add another row or two of activities.


If you need to add a new icon, you can right click on the icon and select "In Line With Text" from the "Wrap Text" menu. This will help placed the icon in the right place.

If you need help adding and deleting rows, columns or icons, please let me know. I can give you demos using the big screen in the McGinley Room
