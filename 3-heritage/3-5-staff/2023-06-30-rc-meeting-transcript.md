Hold on to your ears and interrupt the microphone. Oh, Theo, how's it? You know what? just need to include time to start.
Yeah, I'm going to a lot of room here. I'm not sure if you to be able to have stuff here.
I'm going to a lot of room here. I'm to make lot of here. I'm lot room here. I think you mentioned your microphone.

***

Is this loud enough for everybody? Yes, we're still learning. He's excused the delay where he's learning how to do all this stuff so it just takes a little time.
Keep on going. All right, we will. I think first of all we'll have a moment of silence for the passing of Nancy Stent and Mary Annachette.
So that's a good I'm going to of silence for you. Thank you. Thank Thank you. The full marriage going to make the presentation.
I just wanted to go over the reason. Why we change things. The new format is going to be like this, where we are in a kind of semi-circle.
It's going to be much easier for us to communicate. If we're like this instead of being potato and people behind it, it's like a classroom.
This is much more, I think, inclusive. And that's why we change to this new format. Now, one of the meetings, this is arranged by us.
So we will invite the staff member, if necessary, speak about it in particular, probably might have. The staff member may or may not be included in the meeting.
This particular meeting Mary is going to be included. We want to encourage residents to discuss their thoughts and And so don't be afraid to say something.
If you want to say something, please hold up your hand so I can see who it is and who wants to speak.
And do you want to say something? We can't talk a lot about what you're doing. I'm wondering why we're only having calls for our...
Can we get to this later? We're going to continue on. Yes. Alright. things that we're going to and we discuss will be called action items.
And they will be passed on with the staff with a management. And the action items will be taken up with a town hall meeting, which will take place approximately 20 days.
After the residential council meeting. Now, because this is kind of an experiment that won't be a town hall meeting in July, the first one will be in August.
So this is kind of a way in which we're trying this out. And we want to get the details of our meetings recorded.
And it's going to be much easier to publish. The minutes, as opposed to taking notes that we used to do in the past.
Now, we're going to be, as I say, using the whiteboard, we can use that as almost like a blackboard would be.
And we can also use the zoom facility. So if somebody is perhaps on vacation. And still wants to attend the Urisons Consulme and make them do that remotely.
At the same time, if you just want to be in your apartment and connect by Zoom, you can do that as well.
So that's the reason why we have this particular screen up there. All right. Now, put down the media to marry.
We're going to get married 20 minutes to make the presentation. If she comes by then we have her to follow her up and then go on with other discussion.
Thank you so much. And I'm going to stand in front of this, I believe, so people can sit there.
First of all, thank you to the resident council for working on the change to these meetings. Because what we're actually doing is getting the resident council meetings in line with the contract statutes.
We have a book of laws under the health and safety code. And those are, those are the laws that really support you as residents and how we keep our contracts, the language and contracts, the meetings that were required to have and residents council for instance is required and required to record these meetings.
And the reason you have resident council meetings apart from administration is you're supposed to to talk about us and talk about issues that arise.
You can invite us to your meetings, but you're supposed to be able to talk about issues freely with your council officers.
This is generally called the council, your officers, and you are called as an association. But per the contract section, once I get in writing the issues brought up at this meeting, I have 20 days to come back to you with acknowledgement and solutions to those things.
And that's where the temple meeting comes in. For 20 days, it's about two weeks later on Wednesday. The second Wednesday of every month will have administrative town hall meetings.
And anyone who has to directly supports or supervises something will give a small report. you'll get to hear from us related to the issues brought up this meeting.
We will, we will do that for you. that's per the contract statues. We will also change how we hold the semi annual meetings.
The contract statutes that is not a resident run meeting per the statutes. It is a board and administrative run meeting.
They're going to be very similar to how they're run now, but they won't take, they won't take the place of a residence council meeting.
They'll be on a separate day. They might take the place of the town hall meeting, but we still have a requirement to get back to you with answers.
But that is a board and administrative meeting. A lot of you have been asking for coverage. by administration on the weekends.
And we do have covered 24 seven by administration and most of you aren't aware of this. I want to go out and find out more.
We have four people who the nursing office at Henderson always have our cell phones. And that's Michael Russell per meter tan Jeff Brenner and myself.
Also every Saturday, anti-glamice here and every Sunday, Kevin and I can hear this here. But what you don't also know is when you put a voicemail on our desk phones, we now immediately get an email transcribing your voicemail to us.
And those emails ping on our phones and we know there's an issue when we get back to you. We do not give out our cell phones to the residents of the staff at Henderson clinic to have them with security department has them and they're known.
And the four of us are on Keep don't for any more. Now, unless we're on vacation and we get to the next person, I am always, even if I'm in India, I am always together to call the teleworks.
But Michael would be called if there were any emergency medical situations, staffing issues, any nursing questions or inspectors or outside workers, any suspected resident of use.
For being who's the executive director of human resources, So, I'm what we call if there's an employee injury or some kind of employee issue that she needs to get involved immediately.
Jeff Renner, founding, he oversees the facilities department, gets called for any security, major internet or phone issues, any facility and pipes and those kinds of things.
I get called in addition to all of them. Once they're called, they always call me. And if they can't be reached, I get called.
Likewise, Angie. And Kevin are both here in the building on Saturdays and Sundays. The all clear announcement. First of all, my apologies when the fire alarm went off last week, whatever and ever.
The reset button, we were given the okay to reset it by the auxiliary fire department. It would reset even.
So, so it was going off for a very long time. None of us who were on campus that day knew how to do the all of your announcement.
That's honest truth, myself included. That seemed to have been an oldie. Only really was the one who knew that.
So we figured it out. have it written down with the phone and the Henderson clinic, by the way, and the one that's on the wall.
And we've been written instructions to all the curtain drivers and they're in the Henderson. So I'm sorry. We will do better about that in the future.
I just wanted to congratulate our department. The director is especially Michael and Linda Hibbs and Carina Angie Cortez, the staff who participated in our Department of Social Services annual survey about two weeks ago on a Monday.
They can usually hear for about two hours and they leave and usually it's one survey. And they used to come every five years but now since COVID they're coming every year.
They stay for six or seven hours because we had just applied for a bigger non ambulatory license. And we applied for exceptions for some residents who normally wouldn't be allowed to stay in assisted living and they passed us with no deficiencies.
They were actually really impressed with the agent and place model and how tight Linda Hibbs was able to work with Carina to get that together.
So congratulations to our teams. was really, really an amazing accomplishment. We have applied for this health center. To be turned into the same licensing as the rest of the building, martha nell beatty, pier at the facility for the elderly.
Doesn't mean we're going to fill it with people. It means we're allowed to use it as a dining room, as an activity room.
And we may turn in the four apartments on the square here perry in the assisted living apartments. It comes with a catch though, we have to add more magnetic fire alarm and more.
Many of you have asked for that door to be held open. It's not allowed to be just currently not wired into our fire alarm.
When it's wired into the fire alarm, it is a fire alarm. it's unlocked in the door automatically shuts. So once we have a separate place and we have a we just got a bed and we have the contract with getting ready to come in.
And we have to also add these lit exit signs. have to add some up in the parry buildings at point both directions and both stairwells.
And they also asked us to add some exit signs out into courtyard that get used. We've got the Lagoona Street, it is a little bit of a maze.
Once that's all completed, we're going to promise you're being in a license for RC at the end of this site.
You have to be licensed by somebody. That's kind of adjusted. So we're in the middle of that. And if I don't really use, because we're at Beijing in place, we have a stronger, more but non-annual affordable license.
we've heard me talk about this.-ambulatory means you use use a locker, you're a veteran, or you have a primary diagnosis of dementia.
And our current license says we're allowed to have of those. Guess how many we currently have? 32. So what we've done to sort of slide under the radar for that is we do something called for people who use a locker or who have dementia.
We use something called a timed up and go test. we timed you 30 times. Getting from yours. to the firewell safe area, fire safe in the state of well, and you can get there in under 52 seconds.
That's what the fire department said. We consider you functionally ambulatory, even though you have a walker for dementia. So we are quite, we're just at that number, but we applied for a long, but bigger non ambulatory license, which means you can age in place where you are.
And they gave us, they gave us permission to 57 non ambulatory beds. It says a lot about what people leave about our community, that that agent class works, that we have the right number of staff, and that we, that we're following through on all the guidance that the doors and exit signs.
They told us that they will never make the flats non ambulatory, that they just do not qualify for non ambulatory says, and some are using more than we would have to.
Because they don't have wide enough doors. If somebody was truly bad at reading, some of the doors in mourning aren't wide enough to get that bed free.
So we have to, we've completed that number 57, but this is really good news for us. And you may be aware, some of you might have seen, and I sent a letter out to a couple weeks ago that the next door out.
There's a lot of money to push back from our remain leaders on Princess O Street about our plans for construction.
And what we reminded, we're still, this is still a big hit. We are, the board is built in what we're calling off brands at each milestone for the strategic.
At each, at each point, we want to say, is this still the right thing for us to do? Can we financially do it?
it right to do for the residents? it make sense for our future? So we're at mile two, which is land use permit.
That permit was submitted on February 21st. And we've gone through many back and forths with cities so far and it is doing so as complete.
But it will be likely through the end of 2024, until we get approval or disapproval, until we know where we land on that.
So another year and a half just at land views. Then we have to apply for construction. And that takes time too.
So in that, that's an off-ramp of the board, after land use, as a way to site, and for always looking at what the right things to do.
There's always sort of a four-pronged approach. We know that to stay viable, we have to do things. have to make changes.
So this year we did two big changes. This year we closed the nursing home, because it was a two and a half million dollar expense for us.
But we bought a little over a million of that and expenses would be staffed over two years. We have a million of them there.
And we outsourced our dining staff to Morrison, from the house staff. And that was about a half a million dollars in savings to us.
So those are things we're doing. We've done. We closed the SNF and we outsourced that in hard. We also are looking at how a company come in and just take over our management.
That would be the company. There's that We're companies that would be one of two hundred homes they managed. And that would mean they wouldn't need me.
They wouldn't need John Casey. They would need any executive level positions that we put an administrator in. And their corporate office would supply the executive level oversight.
The problem with that is their fees are based on revenue revenue and our revenue is so low. But they're never quite interested in that with us yet.
So that's one of the. We're looking at and then the last thing is always on the table. It's called affiliation or a merger with another organization.
But we know and the board has really felt strongly that we've been at better position to affiliate if we got ourselves on financial from firm financial foot and jeans, bill and and ourselves to where we're sustaining ourselves financially.
What we don't want as a board or as a resident association. And this lose who we are a heritage on the Marina, we want to preserve culture and the character of the community.
So we think if we get to a point of affiliation, we come to the table a little stronger if we were a better financial footing.
And then John Casey asked me to read this to you. John Casey's our chief financial officer. You ensure that we are working on what the new calculation will look like with the change.
In the first quarter of the year, the skilled nursing needs to open. In the second quarter, we have cost associated with closing of the skilled nursing.
So we now need the third quarter to project what the costs are going to forward going to be so we can calculate the new formula with costing the third quarter and project the fourth quarter.
Once we have these calculations projected. We will make sure that our options We lot of time in our attorneys all agree.
So we do not give you something that will not work with the IRS. This is for people with life plan contracts life care contracts.
You get a medical deduction for your for living here. So John is working on that and it's not as simple as we just need a simple calculation that our lawyers and our auditors involved and we're all working on that right now.
But because our assisted living does care or not care. Our lawyers believe that that's going to kill A lot of people have a that you have on board.
It's not going to be as much, but you're still going to get the back to me. That's all I have.
Any questions? Before we go. Does anybody have any questions for Mary? Yes, Mary. Will John Casey's new fees include the levels of care and assisted living?
The levels of care and assisted living is part of an amendment to your contract. when you get your new fees on July 1, those levels of care, these are included.
Yes. Okay. And I guess it's got to also be called IFC plus. Well, so there's two different ways to look at it.
If you live in the place that's called assisted living, we all know that's first floor to carry and half of second floor of period.
That's what we're calling assisted living work. Some people live in independent living apartments and they're getting extra care. Some are even getting us as living here, but to differentiate with.
All of those I held plus because assisted living still is place when you get co-worker here, but you could be charged in assisted living level of care in independent living if you're getting that level of water.
Okay, so the same numbers. Yes, but you get all based on the formula based on assessment. Okay. Anybody else?
All right, thank you very appreciate the time. All right. Now we're getting to the meeting. I sent the minutes out for the will begin with the source.
you have any of like to say, mop? Hold on. For the month of June, we spent $20 in activities and decorating the first day table and $871 in the garden.
So that's today's We have $13,443 in our residence bank account. Thank you, Paula. Anybody got any questions? Paul? All right, Theo.
So this means this is a technical person is kind of a failure. Because what I was hoping is that we could see on the screen, pictures of the speakers.
And we could also see the notes of the speakers. Because I know a lot of people at the back of the room cannot hear everything, but it would be really helpful if they could read what was going on and then that would help with the hearing.
So this is the first time we are actually trying to record residence accounts meeting. I hope there will be a transcription.
So that after this meeting is over, you will get a transcription and a summary of the meeting in text that you can read.
Or you'll be able to take the straws. I'm not sure it's going to work this time. Essentially, if ever see or hear the entire meeting in its entirety, whenever you want, or watch it on the outside.
So there's a lot of work in progress. This, I don't think work very well, but we're going to learn how to do it.
Thank you, Theo. I have one question for you and that is, I'm one of the residents of breakfast. And that is, if we do record the meetings, it will only be available for residents.
It will not be available for So you have to be invited. have a invitation only with me that somebody has authorized a person to be able to view the meeting.
So once somebody, one of the council officers, does it sound for example, we would like to show the meeting to a board of a corrections member.
So that would be a person or say a family member. So anyway. I think that our meetings are are meetings.
Yes, right. don't think they should go out to families because anything you go from there to another. So let's work out a protocol and written down who we can and have it stated on these papers.
Who can do the meetings and depend on them? I think they're directors. Absolutely. Directors of staff directors. hear I'm saying this staff director is our art also our product.
But they're going to hear about it anyway. The town hall meeting. They will hear what's presented to the town.
So let's go for that. The next officers meeting. Let's let's make a list of who could see it. For example.
I I'm sorry. was talking about who could view the recordings of the meeting meeting off of the streets. What I mentioned is, because he mentioned about other entities having access to our meetings, and I said that I strongly fill these are our meetings.
We live here, we're the residents, not to go to the families, not to go to the friends, um, Board of Directors, I completely concur.
But outside of that, these are our meetings. And even sharing them sometimes that we do with management staff. I think that could skew things per house.
They could look at it ahead of time, make their plans on it. I think that Board of Directors, when everything is approved, should see it, our town meetings,
We're going to take care of sharing what we decide here. That's my feeling. I agree with Martha. Okay. Do you have a question?
Can you put up your hand? No, it's just a degree you can put up. Oh, okay. All right. Anybody got any questions on that?
Yeah. Maybe you should ask her show a hand now for how many people agree with Martha. Good idea. All right.
Can we have a show of hands if people agree with Martha? I think the question was that we keep.
Okay. Do you understand the question? The question is that we keep all of the details about how we can record it.
Versioned completely private. It's our meeting. It's not shared with anybody else except possibly board members. All right. You don't want to share with the board members?
Well, martha is a director. you're an art board. Yes. All right. You don't want the most shared board of directors.
That's what I call the B board. That's fine. All right. All right. I think that's two questions. Two votes.
Two votes to share it with. One to share it with the public. Yes or no? One to share it with the board.
Yes or no? Well, I think we've played with that. We're not going to share it with the public. That's what everybody put their hand up about.
Now, share it with the board. The board of directors. Now, the question is, can we share this details with the board of directors?
Anybody who approved that, please put up your hand. SIS I'm not asking one to give her a name. I'm really sure about your asking.
My words are the minutes are coming. The printing posted. To. they're downstairs. I mean, who's anybody down there? The point is that public people.
That's what minutes are for. They're not going to be secret. If you're talking about things we say here that we don't want to, then the minutes that's something else entirely, that's the recorded.
Minutes are probably. Recording surprise. Well, except if we're going to use recording to print minutes, then we're in trouble.
So I think we should put this to rest for the moment and think it through. That's good. Yeah. For a switch, we have a board member who's in residence.
A resident who's board member. Two of them. Two have two of them. You've got two of them. I think it's absurd to keep anything from board.
I agree. say that the board members is the most negative critical issue here. Theo, there are two board members.
They should hear. Before we present anything to the board of directors. It's approved by the residents. Yes, that's a way of letting it also.
That before we're doing any. Thank you to the board of directors. We have approval from all the residents. Yes.
But that's in terms of actions we want take it. Not just discussion. Do you have a question there? Yes.
It was mentioned that the minutes. It was just mentioned that the minutes are kept in the basement. They have not been kept since January.
And there are a number of people who have asked me how to get access to the minutes currently. And I don't know the answer to that.
I haven't finished some of them since January. I think it is January. I've got some of them. But I'd have given them to them to Melissa.
And I don't know why don't know what happened. Okay. we need to find out. Which response. Hi Defenseman. The type of minutes that are taken, depends solely on who the secretary is, up until fairly recently, maybe pre-pandemic.
We have voted to have only action minutes. In other words, unless we had taken a specific action, Nothing else would go into the minutes except to report that a meeting had been held.
If there were folks taken, those are the actions that would appear in minutes. If we do that and then have recordings that are not uplift, you would have both sides of the picture.
However, I don't know. think we're getting into very valuable territories. As long as the minutes are not written because panel gets pointed out.
would be a situation I agree with Margaret that the minutes that we have coming would be the same action items in those minutes and we're giving the marriage for discussion at the at the whole time.
All means. And that way. That's what we get the public action. All right. All right. Just as a separate area.
not sure I can't tell you how guilty I feel about not producing minutes. The issue is, for example, last meeting took an hour and a half.
It was zero action items, but a lot of interesting discussion. So I came to a quandary. came to a pickle.
What do I do with an hour and a half of people talking. And there are some very important issues ready.
things I would like to highlight, but it's taking hours and hours to take the back recordings that we have and try and make some minutes.
So I hope I'm using zoom and you can automate it. Using and intelligence, we can get some summaries and transcriptions that will make my life a lot easier.
So, we're in progress, but this meeting is a step in the direction of having better minutes and better recordings, even though not just a background, just general discussion.
And then your opinion, all your opinions down somewhere where they can be recorded and acted upon. And acted upon.
No. Not all of your opinions. All your action. Right. Now, that way you deal with this issue of making minutes public.
Yes. I only record any action. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. So these will be recorded. action artists will go upstairs. Okay.
All right. Let's go on. Now, the meeting is now open for people to make observations. Give us that thoughts and feelings.
So we can produce action items from that. So I think we can begin, I think Fred here has got an opinion about, I think you gave us a note here Fred.
Would you like to give us the details of what you wanted to talk about? Yeah. Thank you. This is the subject that I've been mulling for quite some time.
And I don't want to launch into a detailed discussion because I really don't know what the facts are. But I'm concerned about Mary, in my view, subtly producing bills for bandages and things like that.
I have had some serious injuries by falls. I have had some bad cuts. I have had some large bandages.
I have never been able to build, never. And I have an aid for aid patients. I keep hearing words from Mary, the effect that the coverage for medical care for aid patients does not include, quote, and quote.
And I am concerned about that. I don't want to raise a big bus until we get the facts right now.
understand from Joanne that we're about to get a list of what's supposed to be chosen. And I have severe questions about whether that's correct or under a contract.
But they don't want to start a war because I don't know what the facts are. I thought the first thing would be to contact the ombudsman and to find out what he says about that subject.
I actually got to look at our contract. I know that it says medical care. And, you know, so, what's the time?
Maybe just the board of directors of this, it's sitting out with me and we could talk this over. I don't want to go to the very yet, but what she's the current is the contract statute.
I don't know anything about it. I just know that I have been associated with it. didn't have a court yet with three different groups throughout the polls.
I have never heard of this this interpretation before period. You know, can I talk with that? No, no.

I don't right.

Someone has already been charged and paid for a box of band-aid. I don't know if it was $27. It's been done.
Yeah, I'm aware of it now being done, but that's not the question. Question is appropriate. Okay. Well, they've taken the money.
Maybe they'll get it. you are an A contract which means you are in life care and you're paying life care monthly per unit?
You should not ever be charged for any medical attention equipment while you're here. As you are a C contract, continuing care, you get treatment, you get advantages, you get charged for that.
Because you are not paying for the The life care. You know what you do? You take the bill down the job and say, hey, this or don't pay it.
Don't get content to pay it. It's a separate distinction here. And getting medical care, whether you're a or a seat is I have a who I could benefit from the pandemic on.
If I ask somebody to buy me or give me a box of I'm here in N your seat. Well, that's also a distinction of course.
But if somebody can't go out and go shopping, get a friend to shop for you. You don't know that's his bad point.
think you could watch with N. That's, that's different. That's not my little care. I'm in court. in court. known the seat covers.
Those are white and green. They said I have to pay for them from now on so far. I have not been built.
I don't know what category that comes under it. That's what I want. So what was it? The covers for chairs.
Yeah, I don't know what name they used to. It's white and I got green. mean, it's so you. Is that a whole street?
Or is that a medical supply? I think it's medical company in the above life. Okay, I'll come here.

@53:08 - martha nell beatty
Okay.

@53:14 - Heritage on the Marina
to go on, I can make it even more complicated. You have to think about people in the system living.
People in the system living pay extra money. So things like medical supplies, I assume, be the conclusion. Sorry? Do you imagine the contract?
It depends on the level of care in the system living where I have CC Plus. Yes. A-O-M-T. A-O-M-T. But if you're in the C contract and in the system living, you may get a lot of those fees, some of those fees paid for.
So if I don't think, for example, Maddie Jones is not going to go out and buy her own toilet paper.
She is on an assistant living plan where those things are be. So we better need to work out these decent charges and get something written down.
This is really, really good for us to action either. I agree with Theo. This is going to be our first action item.
We've got to get this particular matter of who gets charged, what they get charged for, and if they're in a lifetime contract, do they get billed or don't they get billed?
If they make a kidding, we can't come back and get billed for what, and so on. So we'll make that our first action item.
All right. think even before figuring out the fees, we need to have Mary did mention about four people being on call on weekends.
Okay. today, when everybody's here, I call down if his Pat needed something. I got a registry here. She had no idea who I was, where I was.
She had a look up and see if I was on the bike contract. It's not working. It's not even working when they're here.
So I came down and I look for Michael. So Michael can help me. So the weekends that they're on call is BS.
We need a physical person. We need a physical person. On the premise that knows what is happening and weekends are a lot of registered people.
So I think that's a good idea to help. What is that you're going to do? Could you, she can suit?
You know, the week. I think she really doesn't understand what happens when they're not here and you don't have access.
That's very, very, very, very And she's lucky. one has fallen and done. I think it was something that could really, really hard this premise.
Thank you, martha. This is my big concern. As I think everybody here knows there was an attempted burglary at my apartment.
And in fact, they were able to get in to the building, into the garage, change of my outdoor, And good unit.
And managed to walk back out. This was on the Saturday morning. And the idea that, you know, people were here.
No, I'm not going to go in and say something to the dining room. That's where to get. yes, there was a registry person in the health in it who didn't know who I was.
It's not. It's not adequate. It's not adequate. you. I have a long, I have a long preparation. I was told not to get off the wall, not to get upset, not to get emotional, not to not the nut.
These are emotional matters because it has impacted us across the It's historically me. Who are you? Where you live?
What can I do? That's historic in the in the flats. It's happening here. Pretty pathetic. They don't know our names.
They don't know locations. That's one that means stick to the fact we have lived here for several years now since Mary has been here with leaks.
Thanks. Weeks with mice in our offensive, you know, problems that run around. They're looking at it. This is years.
Elevators consistently bandage to get the place no big land. Maybe now there is how much money we spend on small repairs.
They're building it. Our building is fairly new. I understand that they have problems here. We were under warranty when it went out and it's constantly going out and building.
They have the problem and there's the humblest. Okay, elevator. How much are we spending for the elevator? The other thing was, I can't be my own writing and I'm nervous.
There was somebody who said that there were no lights for two years in the middle Who Who cares? They people don't like to be nasty here.
They're so damn polite. They just are nice and they say it nicely and you say it once, right? We try to then you don't say it anymore.
I had complained and wrote the letter months ago. was a year ago, but I sent part of the board and I got a media response for four years.
There were items in my apartment. Sony was present at the meeting. Small things. Got to get to go. I was like, it.
Four years. had no pressure in my shop. I had to look the twisty. They looked the twisty. No pressure.
These are the kinds of frustrations that we deal with and we keep paying our bills. We keep paying our rent.
And that comes to that as well. Then what blew me up the other day was a toilet paper. That was so lovely.
I went off the wall. All the walls. Boy. My neighbor paid for band-aids. He had a phone on his back and paid for the bus.
Outrageous to me, I said. The carpets, we've been told we have to do our own paying for the carpets they put in.
To, I heard, I was told, Mary, that we will have to pay for shampooing our carpet. The carpets, they know.
That was another note. Okay, I'm still shaking. I can't. Oh, party. I like some of the people here and I like the reward in some way.
In public with other people and so on, we've done that in the garden in the garden. That's what's done.
We bought wine and Jesus and we shared and so on. And now there's something they want to make it uniform.
Why? Like some people better than others. I want to go to some parties and not others. I would like people who want to make those decisions here.
This is my home. And I would like to participate as it is my home. And that's part of the frustration and the lack of consistency.
The and the this business I had a meeting in my apartment because I needed something done. I don't think I'll ever get it done before I've gone.
But they came up and I said, what are now the amenity outside the contract? wasn't. I was read the contract after two pages.
They were reading the contract. I said, I have one of those. I can do that. And. You know, this place.
Well, I'm y The letter from R.E.L.E. never. The big items in the house in this magnificent form need to be taken care of and big bucks at the Easter.
But taking it out on us by nickel and an onion and making it cool, Ken was not a very good manager either, but he helped us.
He was a good person. want to thank you. And prostrated with the idea of prostrated. Unhappy. Yes. other people need to also.
They will. Okay. They will. Well, please. They will. Thank you. The center. Many of us here came because it was continuing here.
Not to move us anywhere else. And the security of that, the feeling of security is done. All right. Thank you.
There are two pages on the table at that speech. One thought of the issue originally, a minute ago, the man, administrative cover it on evening, overnight and weekends.
And the number of topics I've been brought up, which is overall management, there are two separate issues. I'm interested myself right now in addressing management overall in the whole separate issue.
But it's one of those issues of that overnight and weekends coverage. It seems to me that I felt them and called the Henderson for a month or a little deeper.
And I got the nurse who was registering that, who are you, where are you, I'm a staffer. She is a felon.
She is a felon for one shift. Of course she doesn't know my name. Mr. Cortez should have been up here this morning to make sure there were enough chairs to make sure this room was organized and prepared for the meeting.
It shouldn't be the residence room. And that's what happened this morning. For this bad martha's question Friday, weekend, all of that.
John and Ann are gone. And Mr. Cortez is the only man and very crazy. Core works finished profit in to profit back.
I haven't seen any of these. So what I'm suggesting is that we check out. Oh, I'm really suggesting is that item one is the day address having qualified person here on the premises for evenings and.
We can have the access to energy, having access. That doesn't work for us. I wonder what Mary would do as she was here.
I think that that could be next action. I guess number two. Yeah. That's probably enough. You work on sites.
Break you home. Yeah, very simple. I don't know the answer to the. Rough leading problem in the apartment. And I don't know whether it's a rug or a rug.
Furnished by a very difficult personal property. But I was surprised to find out from Jeff that one reason why the hiring of outside people to come in to clean car.
It says that there's a very specific rule that requires the car can speak at least annually and maybe more.
All. So I'm. With respect, somebody goes to pass the look at the plan issue too. I mean, there's so much we don't know about what's required.
Great, think that's an excellent point. It is now almost 11 o'clock. I think if our hacks, if anybody else has got any points we want to bring up, I think we should say something now.
Otherwise, we're going to wrap the meeting up. We're to keep these meetings to just one hour. Do you have a point?
I don't know if you'd like to bring up. So this doesn't have to be an action point, but I'm really curious.
How many are ends we need now, after not having been to yours, and all of a sudden, we have a wellness nurse with me.
No idea that this person was coming or why. Michael's been doing a great job even as a new father.
And his office has suddenly been displaced. And the new wellness person in his office. So it's just curious. some of the CNAs were saying, it's very confusing.
are so many nurses. And I agree. I'm likely to summarize these action points. The first one was the bills for medical supplies.
The bills for medical supplies. We want to get the contracts of the continuing care and lifetime care. The details.
Exactly what is going to be provided under each contract. Who has to pay for what, when are we going to be billed, and so on and so on, what the chart is going to be.
That's our first action item. Our second one is the coverage, nursing coverage over evenings and weekends. Meetings and weekends, who exactly is going to be here, administrative coverage, who is actually available, what that telephone number is going to be, and it should be in some way publicized.
So everybody understands before we can exactly who is going to be in the office or in the health center or wherever they are.
So we can make it bold to get all of them. So this is the direction I'm going be having.
To understand that we follow up on the tools and alarms. And people assisted with him on being notified that it wasn't false or not.
I thought that there was Collinman. She wouldn't want make it from the G.D. don't know how much money they saved on the toilet paper.
Millions, millions, I mean. All right. No, I'm just going to say that toilet paper issue assumes that there's no cost.
Now they're going to have to administer toilet paper coming in, going out, tarsing away, storage somewhere, where there's going to be a big administrative problem.
don't now have. I think we'll talk about the evening and weekend coverage that we say something with a close neck and the nurses who the ones who left majority, it was because of shifts.
They were getting the ship they wanted to say things were changing so much with them. They said we're going to go housework, we're retiring.
Well, if they kept work evenings or weekends, they need to think of their position with us. They work for us.
We don't work for them. And I think that that needs to be a point that should be brought up to them.
Thank you, Ma'am. One of the, Anne, did you have something? You know, I think we're all a little bit vague about the administrative positions that I would like to see in organizational art.
I have a team and a lot of new employees that have been hired. And we don't even know what they do.
I believe there is an organization that's not available. Good enough. All right. We will review the action items and prepare for office to submit to the management app.
The next article that you can be over. There will be another meeting at the residence council. I hope this is going to be a little confusing, but this is the first time we've been something like this.
But I think next time will be probably a little more organized. And I think the time is up. We've spent an hour on this and that's as far as we're going to go.
Thanks very much. screewe hable .... you
