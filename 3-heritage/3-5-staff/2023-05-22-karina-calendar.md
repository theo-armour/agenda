Hi Karina

Attached please find an updated Daily Life Enrichment Calendar: 2023-05-21 HOTM Calendar.pub

It's a work in progress. The current version is a bare minimum. Borders and color fills and other decorations can be added later.

I combined the logo and data into a single text box. This will make it easier to have more space between the ines and paragraphs which makes the text easier to read.

When you want we can have a chat and decide where to go from here

Updates include:

* The layout has been changed to two pages of 11 x 17 landscape. This could simplify printing and copying.
* margins have been reduced to give more space for larger text
* A number of superfluous text boxes have been deleted; The remaining text boxes have been repositioned to line up nicely
* A number of superfluous text styles have been deleted; the single style that remains is called "Normal" with a size of 14 points
* The previous version uses half a dozen fonts (including one that made me laugh: "Lucida Fax" ); all text is is now Verdana
* ALL CAPS has been replaced with bolding; underlining has been removed
* Line spacing has been increased to 1.25 lines to make text easier to read on the front and back pages
* The notice at the bottom of the front page has been deleted
* Other minor changes throughout
