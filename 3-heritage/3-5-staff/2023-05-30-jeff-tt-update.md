Hi Jeff

I am looking at the Touchtown dining menu for today. I see that the menu has not been updated for to display the new summer menu that started Sunday May 21.

I also note that none of the errors, omissions and suggestions that I reported at our meeting March 8 have been rectified.

At the same time I note that the announcements page has been updated with a plethora of announcements - including "Tea with friends ~ Wednesday 2:30 AM ~ Friendship Hall" - which indicates that the announcements page is being updated albeit with bogus data.

It makes me wonder if the money for the Touchtown fees and staff time is being well spent.


>Unfortunately, the program is not fulfilling what we need at the community level. It is extremely time consuming to program and update and, even then, has some issues with the implementation of the changes we have made. For example, the menu changes themselves can take a single user 4-6 hours to update

Ha Ha! Compare and contrast with a WordPress Business site.

* $300 per year
* Real-time updates
* Career-enhancing skills for staff (and residents ;-)
* Plug-ins for menus, calendars, etc
* Multiple security and access levels
* View and edit on any device

And, we could build a demo in a week.
