# 2023-11-12 Residents Employee Appreciation Fund

Hello Residents

Last week, I asked our CFO Jon Casey for a report on how we residents are doing with donations to our Employee Appreciation Fund for December 2023.

Jon's reply included the following donation numbers:

2020:      100,756.00
2021:       59,077.00
2022:       72,958.00
2023:       24,796.00

The 2023 number is a very low. It is for last week. We have time to do better.

Please check that you have made your donation for 2023. If you have not, please do so now.

If you have made your donation, please consider making a second donation.
