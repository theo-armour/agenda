# 2023-11-18 Employee Appreciation Fund update


Employee Appreciation Fund update

Hello Residents

This just to let you know that your good donations to the Employee Appreciation Fund have been accumulating nicely. As of last week, Jon Casey reports that over $85,000 has been donated. This is a good start, but we still have ways to go to match 2020's total of over $100,000. Vivien Dizon from Accounting reports that the average donation is $1,500. The largest donation is $8,000. The smallest is $10.

Jon accepted the Residents Council's request that the final date for donations be extended to November 31, 2023. So if you have not yet made your contribution, you still have time to do so. Or even if you already have, you can still add to it. ;-)
