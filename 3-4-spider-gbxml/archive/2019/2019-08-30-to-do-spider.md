Hello Spider Network

The latest version of Spider gbXML Viewer 'Maevia' v0.17 includes a number of 'fixers'. These are JavaScript scripts that identify issues and fix problems in gbXML files.

https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/spider-gbxml-viewer/

Maevia R12 and R14 can also help you find errors and fix them - one at a time. And these releases are always available if you like them.

But sometimes a model may have hundreds of errors and you would grow old fixing them just one by one. This new version obeys the command: "find all the errors and fix them with a click of a button"

Well, that is the intention anyway. The fixers all need testing and verifying on a nuumber of real-world models.

Please do load one or more of your gbXML files into Maevia, open the 'Fixer memu' and click the 'Run all checks' button.

And then let us know how we can fix the fixers to fix better!

The latest primary Spider gbXML Viewer 'Mavia' is here:

https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/spider-gbxml-viewer

This is a canonical link and should most always link to the latast version.

There are are other builds as well. Read about them here: https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#spider-gbxml-viewer/README.md 

BTW, we have switched to semver.org versioning. So, for example, today's build is : Spider gbXML Viewer 'Maevia' v0.16.01-13.

And, while I have your attention, I am very pleased with the way that the code is currently progressing.

The current viewer:

* Handles very large gbXML files in a speedy, no-fail,fashion
* Loads, extracts and saves gbXML files to and from XML files and ZIP files
* Supports files that are local or remote with one button press file reloading 
* Displays virtually every aspect of numerical and attribute data in the file
* Supplies a variety of 3D visualization aids including exploding, cut sections
* Begins to provide tools to fix any issues found in the files
* Delivers a user interface that may be themed to fit in with the house style of any organization
* Works just fine on phone, tablet or computer
* Runs locally, on server, in an iframe or even embdedd in another app ( such as Open Studio ;-)
* Entirely written in plain vanilla JavaScript with just two dependencies: Three.js and Showdown.js

There have been a number of distractions with development in the past few months. The big issue is that - with me being the only developer - there's a lot of cowboy behavior where anything goes and focus is lost. On the other hand, the various perambulations have served to refactor the code down to a much simpler, more straightforward narrative. The main thing is that my confidence in the product is building and I can now spend more time marketing and supporting.

In terms of a version for Open Studio, for testing and embedding I have been building a version of the Viewer with the only menu being a context-sensitive popup. Have a look here: https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/spider-gbxml-viewer/pop/

If you like the idea, I will have a go a combining all the files into one.

Longer term, I know the goal will to have a full Node/MPM thing. This is good and yet is just somehow out of my range of desires. But fingers-crossed, we can find somebody like Antoine Dao to come to the rescue.
