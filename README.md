## Concept

This repository is for agendas, actions, to do lists, wish lists, issues, links of interest and other information that I want to keep track of


Actions

* To be taken
* That have been taken (journaling)
* Related references and comments

This repository is not for

* General reference
* Lists
* Links sets and bookmarks
* 'how to' lists or tips


## To Do / Wish List

* 2024-01-05 ~ rename repo to simply "agenda" ~ because I've updated the way I'm storing previous years' data


## Issues


## Links of Interest

Start here:

### [Simplicity Read Me]( https://theo-armour.github.io/agenda/#1-simplicity/README.md )


## Change Log

### 2024-01-01

* Much work om Simplicity folder
* Added: responses that my daughters write in response to my request for their input in 2023-12-19 Finish the Design #1.

### 2023-12-30

* Commented out the iframe view
* Major shift in thinking. Sarting a new repo every year makes it much m,ore difficult to access the data from previous years. So, I will try adding new folders for each year inside the existing agenda folders and. prhaps putting previous years on an archive folder
* Major update to Simplicity folder
* Add readme-password.html

Deprecated:

EverNote

* Use same ideas for organizing
* Ditto bookmarks
