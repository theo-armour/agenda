Dear Erika
I hope this message finds you well and designing fun things.
I am back into the digital afterlife project. Please have a look at:
https://EverEverLand.github.io
You will see that your "Digital AfterLife" is prominently featured. It's still the best overview that I have come across. I hope you (and Jerome) will be accepting of this cloning. Please let me know if you would like any further credits or attributions. At some time. I plan to add AI-generated drawings based on your text. I will let you know when that happens.
Also:
I heart the "The Cycle of Life" ARTour
I hope to send out occasional emails on the topic of the digital afterlife. I will add you to the list of recipients. Feel free to unsubscribe at any time.
