Hi Alex
Alex

I do not remember whether the toe fusion procedure is this week or some other time.

In any case, fingers crossed it goes to plan and, heh heh, you are back on your feet soon.

Also, I want to share a thought or two with you:

Generally, for peeps your age, there have not been many "opportunities" to experience the medical system. You are an exception. I think you may agree, it's complex, riddled with issues and quite fascinating. My thought: always be a good patient, listen and take notes. You may be able to help others - children and parents - in the future.

It seems to me that medical personnel can tell you more about the available options after the procedure than they could tell you before the procedure. It something like the options very much depend on your condition after the procedure - which is not known before the procedure. It kind of makes sense. Again, ask questions. Take notes. Share with others.

Fingers crossed - given the shirt duration out-patient procedure - that neither of the above count for much.

And, bravo for organizing a caregiver. It's the sensible thing to do.

Now, back to my colonoscopy prep for my Thursday inspection. ;-)

Cheers,

Theo
