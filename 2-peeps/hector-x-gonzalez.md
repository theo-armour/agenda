Hi Hector

Thanks for your email today. I will follow up separately. 

But below is a follow-up from our meet-up the other day from my friend Olga, who is a biking lady.
Cheers,

Theo

Hi Theo -

There are quite a few cycling groups Hector can join. 

- Fatcake Club organizes rides on almost every weekday morning, at 6:30am. They usually finish every ride at a bakery or a donut shop. https://www.fatcake.cc/rides

- Golden Gate Triathlon Club (where Aaron and I met) usually does various level rides every Saturday. Hector doesnâ€™t have to join the club, just show up as a guest. There usually are Hawk Hill rides every Wednesday, at 6:30am, meeting at GG Bridge Welcome Center.

- 707 Club: They meet every Wednesday and Friday at GG Bridge Welcome Center at 7am, roll at 7:07 and ride up Hawk Hill. They also finish their rides at bakeries.

-Limitless Racing Triathlon Club: a very friendly group that welcomes anyone who wants to team up for workouts. They usually ride on Saturdays in South Bay.

And, of course, Hector is welcome to contact me or Aaron, and we would be happy to ride with him or answer any questions.

Hi Hector

It was really nice to get together last week. I look forward to continuing discussions when appropriate.

Paul Bryzek
Just clicked on your link to Paul Bryzek. I see a good connection with Minimise.

https://www.minimise.today/

Minimize is the company that my daughter Alix has been very involved with. From my memory of our dialogue, it seems like having a dialogue with Minimise might be useful to your startup. Let me know if you need further details. 

San Francisco Cycling
I will get in touch with Olga, my bicycling friend, and see what group she belongs to. 

Dylan, I think
I think we're talking about things that might help Dylan. I think I must mention Jason Carman, who did work at a satellite company but now has a film production company of his own: https://www.story.inc/
