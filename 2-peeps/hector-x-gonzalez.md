Hi Hector

It was really nice to get together last week. I look forward to continuing discussions when appropriate.

Paul Bryzek
Just clicked on your link to Paul Bryzek. I see a good connection with Minimise.

Minimize is the company that my daughter Alix has been very involved with. From my memory of our dialogue, it seems like having a dialogue with Minimise might be useful to your startup. Let me know if you need further details. 

San Francisco Cycling
I will get in touch with Olga, my bicycling friend, and see what group she belongs to. 

Dylan, I think
I think we're talking about things that might help Dylan. I think I must mention Jason Carman, who did work at a satellite company but now has a film production company of his own: https://www.story.inc/
