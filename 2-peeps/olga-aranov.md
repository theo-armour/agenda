Questions
* Why two stairs?
* If two stairs, upstairs bedroom to be kept locked as any other external door
* Only way to large upstairs terrace is through the bedroom ~ why not reverse the stair
* Upstairs bathroom not over downstairs - where go plumbing?
* Upstairs may need more handrails and balusters
* structure seems a bit light in some areas

Want
* All√©e: Perspective view from front entrance through other glass door to object in distance
* Something for children
* Site plan with drive, parking spaces & turnaround, septic tank location and significant trees
