Dear Ruth

I cannot tell you how much I adored being on the Peggy Guggenheim Collection Board of Advisors. Ever since I have felt sorry about my abrupt departure.

There were three reasons why I left

* At the time I was suffering from an infection in my paralyzed leg
* The stock market had dropped a huge amount and I was worried about my investments
* A "friend" and business partner had made off with some hundreds of thousands of my money

But the surprising thing is that all this helped turned my life around. I returned to what I really love doing which is writing and developing computer software programs. For example, I helped develop and promote what is now one the major open source 3D modeling programs (https://threejs.org).

Apart from that, I now live in a beautiful retirement community. all my needs are taken care of. This allows my three wonderful daughters to live their lives without worrying about me.

In short, I am now happier than I have ever been.

In another message I will put together some photos.

Cheers,

Theo
