There are 75 residents here. Probably at least 30 of them have hearing loss issues. Remember, the average age is over 90. 

Today we had a woman come in and conduct a hearing loss support group meeting. As far as I'm concerned, she was a total loss, a wipeout, a fail. She actually knew almost nothing about the clinical condition of hearing or the technology tools available. All she wanted was people to talk about their hearing loss issues. 

I am conflicted. We could have had dozens of people here, but I'm glad they didn't come. They would have learned nothing.But that is speaking with the the bias of a being a comparatively younger "techie". 

On the other hand, these people have allowed themselves to go deaf without seeking help. What she was offering was an opportunity to discuss the personal issues of hearing loss. Not my cup of tea, but what certainly a number of my fellow residents should be considering. 

How do these people allow themselves to be difficult to communicate with when there are readily available tools to help them?

How about a San Francisco visit next Monday or Tuesday? Or possibly Thursday?

Were you able to get to Avenidas today? I hope so. 

What do you like to do when you're there?

I'm always amazed at the brain. Thoughts just keep coming in, day in and day out, year in and year out. You can't stop them. They are incessant. And you have little or no control over them. 

Well, I have learned that if a bad thought comes into your brain, you can tell it to go away. Not always, of course. 

The result is that, for me anyway, every day is different. Even if I stick to a schedule, every day is not quite the same as the day before. 

Anyway, today was rather nice for me. I caught up on email and sent out several emails of introduction, one of which has already worked. Connecting people always feels satisfying. 

I also completed, or fixed, or kind of finalized the program that I'm working on. and installed it on a bunch of websites and they seem to be working. 

and I've just finished doing my 5,000 steps which even included two little short trips outdoors. and I didn't eat too much, so the weight should be good when I check in the morning. 

I think I check or record or keep track of a bunch of little things in my life. And so it's always possible to find some happiness somewhere in what I did during the day. 

And maybe that's part of a little sort of life rules thing that I like to think about: Look for something beautiful. 

I hope your day went well.

>> Well--are you ever lonely?

Yes.

And it's the loneliness in the middle of a crowd, loneliness.

I live with 75 others and have three meals a day with them. And almost as many staff to chat with as I walk up and down the halls, getting my steps in.  All our friends, some closer than others.

Nonetheless, there's nobody here I can talk to about linear algebra, JavaScript, artificial intelligence, and other STEM topics.

There are very few that could talk about economics, political science, historiography, medicine and in any depth. 

Of course I do have these online, but there's nothing better than a good face-to-face discussion that can go on for hours, floating from topic to topic, with somebody who knows what they're talking about. 

So it goes

Prompt: The future is bleak when I am awake at 4:30 in the morning.  My mind is spinning and worrying about rent and a home.
