Hello, Theo,

I just returned from The Stanford Theatre where I watched two silent films starring Reginald Denny, listened to a conversation between David Packard and Denny's granddaughter, and a short documentary.  All week the theatre will have silent films in the evening.  A welcome distraction.

Tomorrow when I talk to my counselor in Minnesota at the National Marrow Donor Program, I will explain how odd it seems that Peer is gone.  Today, I did not cry but did sense detachment.  Something was off.

Recovery will be difficult.  Now it seems that I will have to purchase a new Mac as mine is faltering at 7 years old.

I am tired and it is 1:37am.  Time for sleep, I hope.

Phyllis

>> Reginald Denny

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Denny_(actor)

Extensive career

I've seen him. "Batman" and "Around the world in 80 days."

But he doesn't ring a bell in my brain. But from the Wikipedia entry, it looks like he was an interesting person. After all, he was involved with remote control airplane drones. What is the war thing of the day. 

Anyway, the main thing with me is that I don't really go to movies anymore. 

Why should I be sitting silently next to somebody I would rather be talking to? 

>>I will explain how odd it seems that Peer is gone.

He is not gone. You brain is full of living thoughts about him. Deep down your brain is telling you that Peer wants a PB&J or that the temperature is wrong or whatever he expressed he needed. Just because he is dead, does not mean your "muscle memory" understands this.

For all intents and purposes, my mother is still alive in my brain, but actually she died in a car accident in 1983.

And that's what I'm finding with all the people that have died since I moved into my wrinkly home. As much as possible, treat people as if they're still living. It can't hurt you. It's not likely to bother them.

>> Now, research demonstrates that grief is not linear.

I very much agree and understand.

What I find at least somewhat plausible is that she identified different aspects that do seem to occur with many people in no particular order or strength. And yes there are certainly more than five. And fatigue seems very relevant.

The interesting thing is trying to identify the aspects that one is going through oneself and how they manifest and repeat.

A lot of the aspects involve ruminating - going over the same thoughts over and over again. And a good practice is trying to identify what is being repeated and trying to break out of that pattern. But I am out of my depth here. And I'm sure you with the help of Kara are way deeper into matters like these.

And no matter what, the grief still keeps on coming on.

Peer: very, very few people ever seem to ask: why? It's much easier just to roll with the program. Do what the good "whoever" suggests.

>> I am giving myself a break today.

Yay!

>> Having dinner at the Dempsey's house gave me a happy break from worry 

Yup! Being with people you can talk to makes such a difference. With Peer gone, there's no one to talk to. Therefore anguish sets in.

I've learned to live by myself - and to enjoy it. But it took me forever to learn how to be my own best friend. 

Of course it helps having 75 people living in my house along with 70 or so staff. And everybody is on a first name basis. And if any goes, they get replaced. ;-)

>> I am also mentally tired from all.  

I hear you. Living the same scenes over and over again is toatally draining and wearisome. 

Have you figured out what stage you are in?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief

>> What do you do when you program?

;-) 

It's like asking a chef, "what do you cook?"

I should have something to click on soon.

Here is an old one:

>> It's not easy or clear, 

I hear you. Some days are better. Some days are worse.

It's no way the same thing, but I also had a better and worse day, and I'm not sure which it was. 

There's a part of the software I'm working on that is quite complex. I just tonight realized that there is a much simpler way of handling things. The realization happened after working on the complicated way for weeks. And a part of this code has been lurking in my software, perhaps, for years. 

Now, should I be angry with myself for having spent so many months and hours doing the wrong thing? Or should I be totally pleased with myself for finding the right thing? 

Well, I won't try the new easy way until tomorrow. Maybe it it will have complications too. Anyway, the questions remains: how did I allow my brain to play such a trick on me?


## 2025-06-07

I am happy to hear that you got out of the house and had a busy day.

>>  I have to find myself again.

A most positive and forward-thinking thought! Let that search begin.

## 2025-06-06

You are being very quiet. I would like to be able to say "I hope you're doing okay", but I'm sure that's not actually the way things are for you today. 

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to say or do. In the past, I've been talking about my day and things that I'm doing and thinking about. But that doesn't seem to be fair or equal if the things I'm doing are any fun, which in my life they are. 

This is so hard. 

For you, of course, for me on how to be helpful or useful.

I do hope that you have been getting out, getting some fresh air, and have been to Avenidas. and I hope that you have some plans for the weekend. 

And did you know that today was National Donut Day? And that our dining room had a zillion donuts. And me trying to avoid carbs and sugars and lose weight and things like that consumed a scrumptious diet-busting artisan donut covered in a maple syrup glaze.

So today I did a lot of programming. Though I did do some admin in the morning. 

The nice thing was that I overdrew my bank account. I haven't done this for years, and it wasn't much. So the easiest thing to do was to go to the bank, take some money out from a credit card and pay it into the checking account. 

Well, one of my quite elderly fellow residents here has had a stroke and now he gets around by an electric wheelchair. I invited him to come along with me on the walk down to the bank. To my surprise, he agreed. and he had a lovely time getting out of the house.

I'm thinking that grieving must be very, very hard. It's been decades since I've lost anybody close. My wife and I split up around 25 years ago, but we've been on reasonably good terms with each other ever since. 

So there you are, stuck with all these thoughts, and there's nothing, zero, nada you can do about the circumstances that happened that is causing those thoughts.

What I am very familiar with, however, is ruminating over the same thoughts over and over again. 

I spent much of my teens and twenties ruminating and being depressed and being lonely and not knowing what to do about it.

I'm trying to think of something that would be helpful to say, but all I can say is I've been there. 

Actually, I guess I could also add that I'm no longer there. But even then, I do understand that while you're down, you never know how you're not going to be down. 

And even more bizarre since I live with a lot of old people. Guess what? Death happens quite frequently. On average, 10% of us die every year and there are 75 people living here. Of course, it's not anybody like a spouse, but nonetheless, people that you know and are very fond of. 

So I think one way I process it is that in my brain, they're still alive. I could eat something and say, "Oh, that's what Eleanor likes." or walk past a restaurant that is Bernie's favorite. Something like: what is remembered lives. 

I think the main thing is having things to do, places to go, and most important, people to talk to. 

One of my favorite things to do when I'm lonely is to go to a bar and sit at the bar. Unlike most bars around the world, in an American bar, if you're sitting, you can talk to the person next to you. It took me a long time to figure it out and to overcome my inability to talk to strangers. 

And, BTW, bartenders are like free analysts.

But now you could drop me in almost any American city, and by the end of the evening, I would have a nice new friend. 

I'm just saying, because it took a hell of a long time to get there. ;-)

There are 75 residents here. Probably at least 30 of them have hearing loss issues. Remember, the average age is over 90. 

Today we had a woman come in and conduct a hearing loss support group meeting. As far as I'm concerned, she was a total loss, a wipeout, a fail. She actually knew almost nothing about the clinical condition of hearing or the technology tools available. All she wanted was people to talk about their hearing loss issues. 

I am conflicted. We could have had dozens of people here, but I'm glad they didn't come. They would have learned nothing.But that is speaking with the the bias of a being a comparatively younger "techie". 

On the other hand, these people have allowed themselves to go deaf without seeking help. What she was offering was an opportunity to discuss the personal issues of hearing loss. Not my cup of tea, but what certainly a number of my fellow residents should be considering. 

How do these people allow themselves to be difficult to communicate with when there are readily available tools to help them?

How about a San Francisco visit next Monday or Tuesday? Or possibly Thursday?







## 2025-05-27

Were you able to get to Avenidas today? I hope so. 

What do you like to do when you're there? 

***

I'm always amazed at the brain. Thoughts just keep coming in, day in and day out, year in and year out. You can't stop them. They are incessant. And you have little or no control over them. 

Well, I have learned that if a bad thought comes into your brain, you can tell it to go away. Not always, of course. 

The result is that, for me anyway, every day is different. Even if I stick to a schedule, every day is not quite the same as the day before. 

Anyway, today was rather nice for me. I caught up on email and sent out several emails of introduction, one of which has already worked. Connecting people always feels satisfying. 

I also completed, or fixed, or kind of finalized the program that I'm working on. and installed it on a bunch of websites and they seem to be working. 

and I've just finished doing my 5,000 steps which even included two little short trips outdoors. and I didn't eat too much, so the weight should be good when I check in the morning. 

I think I check or record or keep track of a bunch of little things in my life. And so it's always possible to find some happiness somewhere in what I did during the day. 

And maybe that's part of a little sort of life rules thing that I like to think about: Look for something beautiful. 

I hope your day went well.

>> Well--are you ever lonely?

Yes.

And it's the loneliness in the middle of a crowd, loneliness.

I live with 75 others and have three meals a day with them. And almost as many staff to chat with as I walk up and down the halls, getting my steps in.  All our friends, some closer than others.

Nonetheless, there's nobody here I can talk to about linear algebra, JavaScript, artificial intelligence, and other STEM topics.

There are very few that could talk about economics, political science, historiography, medicine and in any depth. 

Of course I do have these online, but there's nothing better than a good face-to-face discussion that can go on for hours, floating from topic to topic, with somebody who knows what they're talking about. 

So it goes

Prompt: The future is bleak when I am awake at 4:30 in the morning.  My mind is spinning and worrying about rent and a home.
