Hi Stephen

I'm just about to write an email to Karen, but in preparing to do so I thought, well, how is Stephen doing? 
So I thought I'd write you a quick note to say hello and see what's up.

As you could probably guess, I am like a little child playing with fire. In other words, I'm completely inside AI. 

And I assume that you are as grounded in tradition and history as ever.

And if you're ever up for it, I would love to have a discussion. It would never be about convincing or critiquing the other's point of view. It would always be about how can we work together? How can we teach students to actually think and write and create for themselves?

Ready of a Zoom call? Or a phone call? Or a visit?

Cheers,

Theo
