# Gukhui Noh Agenda

Hi Gukhui,

## Email Address
I am so sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I have been using Microsoft Outlook to send out the newsletters. To do this, I have been using an Outlook email address. The problem is that I almost never check this email address. I am going to start using my personal email address — t.armour@gmail.com — to send out the newsletters in the future.

## Letter of Recommendation

I would be honored to help you with your application to the graduate school of creative writing at CUNY. So, yes of course, I would be happy to write a letter of recommendation for you. A deadline of February 1 is no issue. I will make sure to get it done before then. Please send me the details

## Nox-bound
Better: Nox-Bound

See: https://www.letpub.com/author_education_Title_Capitalization_and_You

I see word plays with "Noh-Bound" and "No Bounds" and "N2O-bound". N2O is nitrous oxide otherwise known as "laughing gas". I like it.

## Zine
Got it! Shown here with my great-aunt's letter opener.

Hello Theo,

I was happy to see the moment in the dining room. Thank you again for sharing. I have a couple of agendas I'd like to discuss with you.

I'm considering applying to the graduate school of creative writing for fall 2025 at Hunter College, CUNY. I wonder if you would be willing to write a letter of recommendation. While I'm thinking of you as an executive advisor of SOYUZ BOOKS, you have closely read my writing pieces. If it sounds good to you, I'll be grateful to provide you with my resume and statement of purpose. I understand it entails a significant time commitment. At the same time, I'm afraid its deadline will be on Feb 1st. I would appreciate your consideration of this request.

Besides, I'm working on publishing my English poetry collection, which will be an ebook on Amazon. It is a translation of the hand-made moonbow, but I'd like to make a separate title for it. For the moment, Nox-bound came across. Would you mind if ask your thoughts on it? Attached is the book cover in progress. Any comments are welcome.

From the January newsletter, it's inspiring that you would organize the architecture tour for the community. Thank you as always for spreading creativity.

P.S. I wonder if my latest letter zine will be delivered safely to your mailbox in this timeline.

Warm wishes,
Gukhui
