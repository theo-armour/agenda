# Gukhui Noh Agenda


## 2025-01-26

The recent message I sent you was late night writing with alcohol after a long day.

I don't think it was a message I would send with a clear head in the morning. ;-)

I hope I did not offend you in any way. You are a good person and I am glad to know you.

Hi Gukhui

Some thoughts on your statement of purpose:

Acquiring a masters is useful if you are seeking enlightenment or employment. I'm not sure its as useful when your are seeking enrichment. The internal rhyming here taking precedence over meaning. Anyway: "enrichment" is this context is meaning achieving a good number of readers, being selected as somebody to read by by somebody cool like the New York Times, or getting a book deal or just becoming a "somebody" or something esoteric like that. Getting a masters and being a "somebody" are different things.

What do you want?

***

Your writing is very good, original and provocative. You don't need a teacher, you need an agent.

Acquiring the skills to be a good writer is not the same as acquiring the skills to be a salesperson for other people's writing.

***

You probably speak Korean with a cool accent. Unfortunately this does not translate into your English dialog. Much of what you verbalize takes a huge amount of processing by English listeners. This is not a bad thing. It is just a thing. And it limits the marketability of your writing when it comes to things like podcasts or interviews or readings.

Two options:

1. Work on your English pronunciation. Find a voice coach. Learn the ten or so tricks. Learn how to pronounce the various "th" sounds in English. The "r" and "l" sounds and so on.

or

2. Don't speak, but use AI to speak for you. Sign up with https://elevenlabs.io/ or create an AI character or speaking avatar. Or something like that.

Upon re-reading, this is perhaps the most important point.

Nobody a thousand years from now will care you you speak now, it's w hat you write that will matter.

But if the present matters to you, then you need to think about how you speak to English speakers.

If you are a good writer and you go to a school to learn how to be a better writer, the odds are you won't talk to any writer better than you.

Perhaps you may learn to write better because you are helping others to write better. And then maybe you could think about being a teacher. ;-)

***

I don't know your dream. I don't even know the direction of your dream. Perhaps you don't either. ;-)

And maybe that's OK. A writer just writes. And some writers happen to be discovered.

***

I think my favorite thing might be writing about writing. I think I might be a better writer about writing than a writer. ;-)

***

All writing is bad. We should all be Socrates. And just ask good questions. Out loud.

***

Talk sucks. You say the most brilliant thing and it just evaporates. Writing is forever. ;-)

***

The future is performative.Joe Rogan is the future.

***

I gave a seminar/tour here today and it was wonderful. I think I might be a better tour guide than a writer. ;-)


***

So that was a lot of words coming down after a "performance". I hope you find something useful in them. ;-)

Cheers,

Theo

Hello Theo,

I’d like to share revised my statement of purpose by following thoughts from my gut. Came to think of it, I would apply for majors in communication or marketing. Honestly, I believe writing skills improve only by oneself rather than in school. It’s why I’d hesitated to be the graduate so far.

However, I move on to the next step to be more professional. The revision focuses on practical ideas for my press mostly, as considering the MA is one of the ways to reach my goal.

In the meantime I researched other programs like the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, now accepting applications for this summer.

Attached is the last half of writing, revised parts. I appreciate your thoughtful feedback and insights.

Warmly,

Gukhui

I launched my independent press, Soyuz Books to bridge the gap by amplifying singular voices from Korea to global readers.

I aim to manage a press focusing on digital formats and hand-crafted art books. In the AI era, this approach offers a unique distinction from a sustainability perspective. I experimented with this concept by hand-biding my poetry collection, moonbow in 2022. Acquiring readership proved most challenging. In the initial phase, publishing a Substack newsletter featuring new American market titles, writer interviews, and virtual literary tours to engage grassroots readers in the US. To boost efficacy, I'm taking online courses in marketing specialization and social media advertising.

My long-term goal is to contribute to the Korean literature scene as both a writer and a publicist. While observing the concurrent worlds between Korea and the US, I have collected words from the vantage point. It is time to let them fly broadly.

The MA program would provide the essential guidance to develop my aspirations further. Through graduate studies, I seek to explore narratives of cultural intersection, identity, and isolation, revealing how shared human experiences connect across diverse contexts. Thank you for considering my application.

Hi Gukhui,

## Email Address
I am so sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I have been using Microsoft Outlook to send out the newsletters. To do this, I have been using an Outlook email address. The problem is that I almost never check this email address. I am going to start using my personal email address — t.armour@gmail.com — to send out the newsletters in the future.

## Letter of Recommendation

I would be honored to help you with your application to the graduate school of creative writing at CUNY. So, yes of course, I would be happy to write a letter of recommendation for you. A deadline of February 1 is no issue. I will make sure to get it done before then. Please send me the details

## Nox-bound
Better: Nox-Bound

See: https://www.letpub.com/author_education_Title_Capitalization_and_You

I see word plays with "Noh-Bound" and "No Bounds" and "N2O-bound". N2O is nitrous oxide otherwise known as "laughing gas". I like it.

## Zine
Got it! Shown here with my great-aunt's letter opener.

Hello Theo,

I was happy to see the moment in the dining room. Thank you again for sharing. I have a couple of agendas I'd like to discuss with you.

I'm considering applying to the graduate school of creative writing for fall 2025 at Hunter College, CUNY. I wonder if you would be willing to write a letter of recommendation. While I'm thinking of you as an executive advisor of SOYUZ BOOKS, you have closely read my writing pieces. If it sounds good to you, I'll be grateful to provide you with my resume and statement of purpose. I understand it entails a significant time commitment. At the same time, I'm afraid its deadline will be on Feb 1st. I would appreciate your consideration of this request.

Besides, I'm working on publishing my English poetry collection, which will be an ebook on Amazon. It is a translation of the hand-made moonbow, but I'd like to make a separate title for it. For the moment, Nox-bound came across. Would you mind if ask your thoughts on it? Attached is the book cover in progress. Any comments are welcome.

From the January newsletter, it's inspiring that you would organize the architecture tour for the community. Thank you as always for spreading creativity.

P.S. I wonder if my latest letter zine will be delivered safely to your mailbox in this timeline.

Warm wishes,
Gukhui
