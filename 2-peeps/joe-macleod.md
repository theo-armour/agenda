## what a wonderful and varied life and career you have had < Having

And therefore we want the off-boarding to be just as varied and wonderful. I am looking forward to our chat.


## I couldnâ€™t see one of them because it asked for a flash plug in

Bingo! I included the link purposefully.

The off-boarding of Adobe Flash had unendearing consequences. I'm glad you noticed.

BTW, mementomori-0.net  ~ https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/art/mori/ was the first and only work if Internet art I acquired. It should have been obvious to me that it would come to an untimely demise.


## On Boarding Ends: first thoughts

Thank you for the link & coupon. I have read the work quickly, but just enough to get a sense to say the following:

Pros

* Two nice bits I remember: Kondo & 7-day British bank transfers
* Well edited and researched
* Starts from first principles ~ death, etc
* Considers views of multiple cultures and beliefs ~ not just whiteyville
* SDGs-friendly
* Standing on shoulders of giants ~ authors mentioned by name and work in the text
* Links feel like they follow Google's EEAT ~ Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness guidelines
* Exhaustive ~ A Whole Earth Catalog of endings
* Organized into consistent & coherent: Topics, categories and lists
* Sections have headings
* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them
* Footnote references have clickable links
* Interestingly illustrated
* Personal
* Very much a way of writing that I approve of, judge favorably
* Probably more

Cons

* Very depressing. Every silver lining has a cloud.
* Some parts feeling their age

## Next Steps

Much of what I have done up to date feels like the efforts of "desperate legacy creators", nonetheless I remain hopeful that there will be happy endings where they all lived happily ever after. Or maybe it's their deepfake, mini-me, digital twins.
;-)

I have downloaded the epub version of Endineering. From a quick glance at the contents, it feels like a work I will be interested in reading because it looks like it has ideas about designing for happy endings.

I look forward to our chat. I would to read it and get back to you with my thoughts as and when we talk. How about some morning PST Thursday, Friday or this weekend.
