## 2024-02-07 Off-boarding your life

* Off-boarding end-of-life is a thing
* How can we help?

### Final Design three points

Tie up loose ends; make it easy for a happy ending.

Prepare to end your life following the three reminders of the final design.

### Leave no trace

* In general: Follow Burning man's ten principles
* In particular: Leave no trace
* Leave as we came in ~ with nothing
* Leave little or effort required to "clean up" by those left behind
* Exercise the right to be forgotten


### What is remembered lives

* Digitize your life
* All of it
* Put it all up on the cloud
* Internet Archive
* Exercise the right to be remembered


### Heavenly bonus points: Recreate

* Amuse yourself
* Again, create something new
* The end becomes a new beginning
* a recreation ( an amusing and new creation)
* Exercise the right to be reborn


## 2024-02-06 Endineering

Endineering is not the book I had anticipated after reading Ends.

If I had read Endineering first, I might have a different view.

In my current view, Ends may be a better book. I am not sure though and will continue the review

### Editions ~ Versioning

* Book is now very old
* Update it digitally at lease once a year
* Add the ability to be a college text. Add questions at the end of chapters

### Branding

* What is your end-game" Your personal off-boarding?
* Too much work for you; need help
* Avoid creating a star network
* Separate "news" from "reference"
* Separate possible projects from actual projects

### Content

* links in the text?
* Book is boring; diagrams repetitive;
* Loose ending

### Off-boarding

Pre-sale support is growing

* The audience talks back
* Amazon reviews
* Services: Yelp reviews

After-sale support is growing

* Ebay & Craigslist are a thing
* Trade-ins are a thing:
* Trade in phones & computers are a thing

After markets are a thing

* Houses, cars
* Goodwill, Salvation Army

## Course

## what a wonderful and varied life and career you have had < Having

And therefore we want the off-boarding to be just as varied and wonderful. I am looking forward to our chat.


## I couldnâ€™t see one of them because it asked for a flash plug in

Bingo! I included the link purposefully.

The off-boarding of Adobe Flash had unendearing consequences. I'm glad you noticed.

BTW, mementomori-0.net  ~ https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/art/mori/ was the first and only work if Internet art I acquired. It should have been obvious to me that it would come to an untimely demise.


## On Boarding Ends: first thoughts

Thank you for the link & coupon. I have read the work quickly, but just enough to get a sense to say the following:

Pros

* Two nice bits I remember: Kondo & 7-day British bank transfers
* Well edited and researched
* Starts from first principles ~ death, etc
* Considers views of multiple cultures and beliefs ~ not just whiteyville
* SDGs-friendly
* Standing on shoulders of giants ~ authors mentioned by name and work in the text
* Links feel like they follow Google's EEAT ~ Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness guidelines
* Exhaustive ~ A Whole Earth Catalog of endings
* Organized into consistent & coherent: Topics, categories and lists
* Sections have headings
* Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them
* Footnote references have clickable links
* Interestingly illustrated
* Personal
* Very much a way of writing that I approve of, judge favorably
* Probably more

Cons

* Very depressing. Every silver lining has a cloud.
* Some parts feeling their age

## Next Steps

Much of what I have done up to date feels like the efforts of "desperate legacy creators", nonetheless I remain hopeful that there will be happy endings where they all lived happily ever after. Or maybe it's their deepfake, mini-me, digital twins.
;-)

I have downloaded the epub version of Endineering. From a quick glance at the contents, it feels like a work I will be interested in reading because it looks like it has ideas about designing for happy endings.

I look forward to our chat. I would to read it and get back to you with my thoughts as and when we talk. How about some morning PST Thursday, Friday or this weekend.
