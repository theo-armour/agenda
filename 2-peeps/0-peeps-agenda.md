## 2020-07-26

Sometime in the 17th of August I will move from where I've been living for 20 years into an independent living facility.

This will be a self-inflicted game changer

I will move from

* Living by myself to living with 200
* 700 sf to 225 sf
* 4 windows to 1
* 4 closets to 1
* Shopping and cooking for my self to somebody else doing it
* Eating by myself to eating with a couple of hundred
* Having a private living room to a shared living room
* Living on 21st floor to second floor

I could have chosen a bigger space, I chose smallest. Live like a nun. Bare minimum. Here is what I want:

* A bed, a chair, a desk, computer and wifi

if I can live with Justice, this would be wonderful. if I cannot then well let's move me up to a larger space.

more fun to start small and then move up instead of starting so much smaller and then having to go to even smaller

This should significantly decrease my cost of living

Currently

* ~$4.000 per month for housing
* $3,000++ for food and entertaining

Heritage

* 107,350 entrance fee
* 90 day no charge exit
* 2% per month amortize after that 0 o back after 5 year move out or death
* $3,375 per month
* 3 meals
* Utilities
* Cleaning and sheets
* Wifi
* Transport - some included
* guestroom $130?? per night
* guest dinner $25??

Having access to

* Physio therapist
* Nutritionist/dietician
* Social director

New friends

* As we get older, our friends tend to die
* Here I've got 200 friends **always**

Benefits

* Healthy diet - my current diet is what I choose to buy. It is not as varied and all-inclusib\]ve as what a nutritionist would specify
* Night-owl push-back ~ be a regular person
* Walkability
* Much cheaper entertaining
* Social life with leess alcohol
* Intentionalsity / Agency / Usefulnesss
* Friends that work
* Feedback??
* Community
