We can generate some training data sets and test data for the AI models. This sort of thing:

* profession [realtor, lawyer, therapist]
* product type [retail, light industrial, office, residential, mixed use]
* customer type [buyer, seller, renter]
* customer age [18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 66-75, 76-85, 86-95, 96-105]
* customer education [high school, college, graduate school]
* customer residence zip [ 94111, 94941, 94123]
* location type [urban, suburban, rural]
* language [ Spanish, English, Mandarin]

The test data can be some of their existing clients, which might look something like this:

Realtor in Belvedere, CA selling the residential properties of high-net-worth individuals who are 56-65 years old, have a graduate degree, and live in Tiburon, CA

Realtor in San Rafael, CA helping spanish speaking residents acquire condos in the Canal district of San Rafael.

Realtor in San Francisco, CA helping young professionals acquire condos in the Mission district of San Francisco.

The objective would be to create demo websites that are nearly instantly to show the prospective client that contain images and text have been crafted that support the client's business. The demos might even be available within minutes of the initial conversation.

Subsequently - given access to the client's LinkedIn, emails and other data sources, we could create a more complete demo that would be "talking" the client's own language.

Here is are papers on AI threats And AI Foom

https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#13-technology-applied-sciences/computing/artificial-intelligence/ai-threat.md

https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#13-technology-applied-sciences/computing/artificial-intelligence/ai-agi-foom.md

Also please have a look at: https://websightdesign.com/

Let me know if you can come up with some cool AI projects for them.

Theo

Vish: Voice & AI. How could this help Acelya?

Instead of trying to prevent bad things from happening how can help more good things to happen?

Hi Acelya and Vish

I look forward to hosting you at our holiday lunch tomorrow.

Can you be here at 12:00?

It's a very American main menu tomorrow - BBQ ribs and hot dogs, but there are lots of veggie options too.

After lunch, I will show you around.

Please come in the front door at 3400 Laguna Street - between Francisco and Bay.

Dress is casual but if you have something red, white and blue, that would make the old folks happy.

Theo

Mount Sinai Researchers Use New Deep Learning Approach to Enable Analysis of Electrocardiograms as Language

https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2023/mount-sinai-researchers-use-new-deep-learning-approach-to-enable-analysis-of-electrocardiograms-as-language

This link is just for inspiration. Unfortunately, the article does not link to the actual paper.

The question at hand is, for example: how will the professor of English know that the poem she is reading written by a student is a work of a genius? And the other poem is merely an amalgam of Dylan Thomas and Chaucer.

A good idea may be to consider developing a new language to describe something complicated. Of course, the typical numbers and symbols used in advanced statistics may be useful to some. R values and standard deviations are lovely. But more understandable to the common person is a vocabulary in English. The words, of course, would be generated using generative AI.

Put another way, if the genius early adopters can generate an output understandable by their dimwitted bosses, you are halfway to getting a purchase agreement.

Using the following ideas, please teach us the concepts described in the link below.

Richard Feynman, a 1965 Nobel Prize winning physicist for quantum electrodynamics, challenged his students to understand concepts by explaining the concept in simple language as if you were teaching it to a new student.

Step One: Choose the Concept You Want to Understand

Write it on the top of a sheet of paper.

Step Two: Pretend You Are Teaching the Concept to a Child

Write an explanation of the concept on the paper as though you were teaching a child.

Step Three: Stuck? Go Back to the Source Material

Re-read or re-learn the material until you can complete step two.

Step Four: Simplify & Create Analogies

If your explanation is wordy or confusing, simplify the language. Create an analogy to help understand the concept.
