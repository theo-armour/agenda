Hi Shammah

Your paper reflects deep thought and extensive knowledge of social networks and digital currencies.

I know and understand and agree with the issues you bring up with social networks as they stand currently. I generally follow your lines of thought on the technical implementation thought, of course from a layman's perspective.

There are many possible questions that could be asked, but what I want to try and do is to identify three important ones, ask them, and discuss solving them. Then revise and repeat.

First, it would be useful to identify target audience for this paper.

Second, it would be useful to some text that provides examples of use cases, goals or objectives that "change the way humans communicate and think by enabling us to focus our attention on information which is objectively valuable" that can be understood by a CEO, VC or a layman. No matter how technical a paper is, ultimately the techie reader will have to explain it to the bean counter. A techie armed with the benefits of the technology in words that laypeople understand is your friend.

thirdly, it would useful to outline the current stage of development of the technology and the next steps you envisage. This will help to identify the most pressing issues and the most important questions to ask relating to the next update of the paper.

I hope this helps by giving you a few, fingers crossed, short, useful and actionable suggestions.

Cheers,

Theo

Seriously, write it down. If you lose it - we won't be able to help you to recover your Bitcoin Cash.

Also, take a note of our derivation path - it is

using BIP39. It's pretty important too.

Social capital broadly refers to those factors of effectively functioning social groups that include such things as interpersonal relationships, a shared sense of identity, a shared understanding, shared norms, shared values, trust, cooperation, and reciprocity. However, the many views of this complex subject make a single definition difficult.

In economics, a public good is a good that is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be excluded from use or could be enjoyed without paying for it, and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others or the goods can be effectively consumed simultaneously by more than one person.[1] This is in contrast to a common good which is non-excludable but is rivalrous to a certain degree.

I tend to work on things for long periods of time, so I am looking for ways of sharing data with
