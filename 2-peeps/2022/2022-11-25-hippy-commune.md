Getting up this morning was depressing. Well, any morning where you feel it would be a good thing to eat a bunch of prunes is off to a dismal start. Anyway, here is the last paragraph of what I wrote just after breakfast:

> I say all of this because I'm feeling slightly down today. I'm looking forward to the future and comprehending that in order to return to where I was before my hip fracture will take a number of weeks if not months. Or even perhaps never.

What I was thinking about was my walking abilities. I am now able to walk thousands of steps a day - which is wonderful. But I can only walk with both hands tightly clutching a walker. Without the walker - in the bathroom for instance - I rely on handrails, basin counter tops, ledges and whatever to haul myself around. Even going a few feet from walker to table using a cane feels like a distant dream.

Um, then later in the morning, Jonathan the PT came along. He had me facing the long handrail on the wall and having me slither side ways with my right hand clutching the rail and my stump pressing against the wall. And I slithered. Not far, perhaps a few inches each step. I slithered the length of the rail then started slithering back. While doing this, I notice that my stump is pressing only lightly against the wall. Can I pull my stump away from the wall just a bit? Why, yes I can! I slither side ways all the way back just with my two legs and hand on hand rail. Wow! Now back at the beginning, Jonathan says "Now, turn ninety degrees". I rotate and slither forward just a few inches at a time with just my two legs and holding just the handrail. Just as I will do next week walking not with a handrail but with a cane. ;-)
