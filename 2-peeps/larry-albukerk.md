Hi Larry

I am delighted with the thought of the Challenge Athletes Foundation event on the 10th. Thank you for thinking of me.

But, sadly, the reality is that I am too much of a fall risk. If I stand still too long, a leg tends to buckle and I fall. Guess what happens when you start having engaging conversations with people? You talk and stand still.

Also I am recovering from a UTI and taking an antibiotic - so no alcohol until after the 10th.

May I propose an alternative plan? You and your family become my eyes and ears. I draft 5 to 10 questions for all of you to observe and report back on or to inquire about.

Sometime after the 10th, we meet for coffee and juices on Chestnut Street and you and your family report back and tell me what you saw and heard.

## Questions

I have unusual disabilities. I am a partial paraplegic from the waist down and my left hand was amputated. Having disabilities to both upper and lower extremities is quite rare. Even so, I will be interested to hear about the latest advances in sports equipment for the disabled. I have a few questions:

* There are many types of disabilities: mental, sensory and physical. What types of disabilities are generally being catered for?
* Anybody catering to invisible disabilities - blindness, deafness and incontinence?
* Anybody catering to people with hand amputations?
* Any exhibits with exoskeletons - frames that you can attach to your body to aid mobility?
* Any upright walkers? See https://www.amazon.com/ELENKER-Rollator-Mobility-Backrest-Armrests/dp/B07W43JTDG/ref=sr_1_2_sspa
* Are there any digital monitoring devices that do not require a wrist? Putting on a watch when you have one hand is a challenge.
* Adaptive clothing
I Sometimes I think about getting a tricycle, but with the last one I had, I fell twice. I also once had a recumbent four wheeler, but it was too low to be seen by cars and trucks. I am not sure if I should try again. Anybody have any suggestions?


 I will be attending an exhibition of sports equipment for the disabled. I am interested in learning about the latest advances. What should I look for? What questions should I ask?
