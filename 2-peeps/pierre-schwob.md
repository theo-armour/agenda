Hi Pierre

I would be delighted to visit you in Palo Alto, but my aging mostly paralyzed legs say otherwise.

Nonetheless, I remain in total admiration of Classical Archives. In an alternate life I am a classical aficiona, but sadly that is not my current reality. These days I write my code to the sound of the keyboard.

These days I live here: Heritage on the Marina - which I thoroughly enjoy. The average age is over 90. I am one of the babies. I figured better too soon than too late.

What I like is that If I hurt myself or get sick there is 24 hour nursing care. Yet with my maximum walking distance of say 500 yards (with a walker), there is a gamut of opportunities - from Michelin three star to authentic dive bar.

I could go on and on about what goes on in my life. And that is the issue: I say "yes" far too easily. But perhaps getting opportunities for joy at a rate of faster miles an hour is not a bad thing.

I hope that you are engaged and active as ever - and still taking students out for a spin in the Bay on your yacht.

Cheers,

Theo
