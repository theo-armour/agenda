Want memory of the future?  Try this: imagine you are ten years older and writing about this year.  What would you say?  What would you want to say?  What would you want to remember?  What would you want to forget?  What would you want to change?  What would you want to keep the same?

Then ten years from now ask yourself to write it again from the perspective of your age now!

Hi Aaron

This is a little cry for help.

You have seen the people I live with and the disabilities I contend with. And you have seen that I contend well.

The issues is that there is nobody in the neighborhood to talk to about AEC, inequality, Internet & AI or anything technical, scientific or political. Nor do I have a workplace to go to that might include some of these aspects of life.

I am not asking for much. Just a little time to talk about things that matter.

Would you be willing to meet me for a coffee or a beer or a walk in the park?

Theo
