Hi Aaron

This is a little cry for help.

You have seen the people I live with and the disabilities I contend with. And you have seen that I contend well.

The issues is that there is nobody in the neighborhood to talk to about AEC, inequality, Internet & AI or anything technical, scientific or political. Nor do I have a workplace to go to that might include some of these aspects of life.

I am not asking for much. Just a little time to talk about things that matter.

Would you be willing to meet me for a coffee or a beer or a walk in the park?

Theo
