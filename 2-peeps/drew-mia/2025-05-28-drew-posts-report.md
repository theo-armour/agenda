# 2025-05-28 Drew Posts Report

Hi Drew

The past few days have been interesting. They involve you.

After looking at your pitch desk, I had a lot of thoughts, and even more and more thoughts. 

Because I feel they could be useful to others, I have written in the format as blog posts. The posts do not discuss SF Ownership nor the nature of its business. They do talk about "M&A" and "Drew" is referenced. Here are the links:

All are here: <https://theo-armour.github.io/2025/> in the "blog" section

There's a lot to read here. I hope you can skim fast. ; - )

All of this is based on a content management system (CMS) that I've been working on for a while for saving and editing files on GitHub. Currently I'm working on a major upgrade.

The only real purpose of this website is to archive stories and to use them as a launching point for articles that will eventually go into places like Substack.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this. In particular, let me know if if I have written anything you do not want publicly available.

Cheers,

Theo
