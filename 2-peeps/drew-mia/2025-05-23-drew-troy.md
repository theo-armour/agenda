The _Dawn of Everything_ signals a paradigm shift, profoundly transforming our understanding of the human past and making space to imagine new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual and political range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and hopefulness.

TL;DR ~ Accounts of human history

1. Simply aren't true
2. Have dire political implications
3. Make the past needlessly dull ~ Actually more playful
