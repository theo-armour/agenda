Hi LD

Thank you for hosting a memorable birthday party for Noel.

I was delighted that Noel seemed to remember me. I would be very pleased to visit Noel again. There is something interesting about how he questions and expresses his curiosity while nonetheless expressing knowledge of his memory loss. I could see me writing something about this somewhere. I leave it up to you to consider a time and method for doing this. 

I would like to report that I had an engaging drive home with your brother Kent. It turns out amongst many other commonalities, we had an interest in The Interval, the bar cafe of the Long Now Foundation. If he's ever back in town, I'd be happy to meet up with him. In any case, kindly send him my regards and thanks for the lift home. 

And of course, I'd be very delighted to meet up with you and your coterie of good people (Norman, Zarina et al) as and when a suitable opportunity arises. 

Cheers,

Theo
