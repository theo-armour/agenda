## Display Paradigms ~ Separation of Concerns

We talked of using 3D Mind Maps to display content. This is a good idea, but we need to be careful to separate the concerns of the data and the display. The data should be stored in a way that is independent of the display. This will allow us to change the display without changing the data. And vice versa.

### Thinking out loud: Alternative display paradigms of possible interest

* Textual: any particular trail described with words only. All able to be podcasted
* 2D game board with 3D pieces
  * Think of a chess board with 3D pieces, but it's dungeons and dragons
  * Move pieces to alternate locations and let AI determine possible alternative outcomes
* Full 3D gaming environment ~ with court buildings and offices and papers flying back and forth and avatars holding meetings
  * Cartoon style
  * Courtroom drawing style
  * Photorealistic styles
  * See https://unity.com/

The mental model to keep in mind is "Separation of Concerns".


### Recent 3D Mind Map Examples

My efforts from 2020 or so are not as sophisticated as the current tools. I have been using Raindrop.io to collect and display my 3D Mind Maps I came across:

## Communication ~ text messaging vs email vs GitHub

In my world, we have to share:

* Code
* Bug reports & issues
* Documentation
* Wishlists
* & much more

Test messaging is fine for scheduling and checking in, but text messaging is not a good way to share the type of information listed above. I might be able to text you each time there is an update, but that is not a good way to share information with a group of people. We need a better way to share this information.

Text is fine for messages up to ten to twenty words.

Email is fine for simple topics and messages up to a few paragraphs.

For anything larger or more complex, I use GitHub and VS Code for most of my efforts. And I am trying out Notion.so to communicate with my daughters.

How do you generally tackle these issues?


## Projects ~ Project Definition

Needs

* Name < Important, a word or two, a code name, a project name whatever
* Vocabulary / Schema of essential terms
* Vision

A project without a name is like a room without a door. It is hard to get in and out of. It is hard to talk about. It is hard to remember. It is hard to find.

### Project Definition Template

In our recent conversation, we talked about a template to describe a project. Here is a template that I have used in the past to kick things off. It is a Notion template:


<aside>

ðŸ’¡ **Notion Tip:** Here at Notion we use this template to help teams plan, design and develop products with the greatest chance for success. It helps teams think through their work more deeply, improves asynchronous communication with other teams, and creates space for collaboration.

### ðŸ‘€Â Problem

> **Example questions to answer:**
What problem are we solving? For whom? When do they experience this issue?
What data, research and feedback do we have that explains this problem?
Which customers are we working with, or hearing from, to better understand this problem?
Why is solving this problem urgent? Why is it important?
>
*

---

### ðŸ’­Â Proposal

> **Example questions to answer:**
How are we solving this issue? What alternatives did we consider?  Why did we land with this?
What is the general shape of this solution? Do you have any mocks, prototypes, relevant comparisons in the market?
How will we know that weâ€™ve solved this issue? What will we measure?
Have we considered how weâ€™re building this to be fast, performant, scalable and/or relatively low-cost on our services?
>
*

---

### ðŸ›«Â Plan

> **Example questions to answer:**
What are we building?  How does it work? How do we know that it works? What are we measuring? When will it be ready?

**Then, answer these questions:**
>
> * Question 1: Does everyone know what are we launching?
>   * [ ]  **Internal alignment**
>     * [ ]  Can we explain what this change is?
>     * [ ]  Have you shared details of this change with other functions?
>   * [ ]  **External messaging**
>     * [ ]  How are we going to communicate our launch to customers?
>     * [ ]  How will customers understand changes due to this launch?
> * Question 2: Are we sure this is going to work?
>   * [ ]  **Quality**
>     * [ ]  Has this product been tested appropriately?
>     * [ ]  Have we checked for effects on other products?
>     * [ ]  Have we done capacity planning?
>     * [ ]  Do we have a contingency plan if the launch doesnâ€™t go well?
>   * [ ]  **Measurement**
>     * [ ]  Do we know how to tell if this launch is a success or not?
>     * [ ]  Can others see how this launch is going?
> * Question 3: What are our launch steps?
>   * [ ]  **Plan**
>     * [ ]  Have you agreed on launch audiences with PMM?
>     * [ ]  Did we agree on launch steps with PMM?

## Open or Closed Source

[first draft]

Everything I do is open, here is some of my thinking:

* At my age that last thing I need is people making demands of my remaining mortal coil minutes
* I have  fair amount of money. Goldilocks amount. Not too much, not too little. Just right.
* I may not have billions to throw around, but I have a fair amount of accumulated wisdom to share around
* I do not want to be beholden to others

At the same time, I want a wide possible audience, dissemination, people involved and use of my work. Linus Torvalds, Guido van Rossum, Kernighan & Ritchie, Bjarne Stroustrup, Alain Colmerauer & Robert Kowalski and others are heroes. They have created far more wealth and social capital than Steve and Bill. They have made the world a better place by **sharing** their work.

If I am in the very fortunate position of having the ability to share, then I am obligated to share.

## The "Final Design"

[Work in progress]

What is to be remembered? Very interesting question!

If I hear you/Mike correctly, then every iota of legal procedure anywhere, any time, is to be remembered. Every action sets a precedent. Precedents are important. They need to be remembered.

Recording these facts is hugely important. The failures, the lessons learned, the bad outcomes, the bad people, the bad ideas. We can learn from these.

And yet, this only covers the very bad things, sorry outcomes and intransigent issues that people do.

But what about the good things? The good outcomes? The good people? The good ideas?

I talked with you about my "final design". And you [highly simplified] replied by talking about these aspects of life being forgettable for you.

So, I agree there should be a UN declaration of Human Rights clause on being forgettable. But I also think there should be a UN declaration of Human Rights clause on being rememberable.

Putting it another way: I described my "Final Design" thing as being all about tieing up all the loose ends of my life and creating a virtual reality "Matrix" of my life. You replied by talking about being forgettable.

Well, suppose I frame my ideas another way? Let's say I wanted to write the autobiography of an interesting life? In order to write that document it would be handy to have access to to `every court case`, my old faxes or whatever.

So, what I want to do is to write my autobiography. To do something that people have done for millennia. And in doing so, to be able to access all the information I need to write that document, and at the same time to make it some how authoritative

At the same time the last thing I would want is to have whatever I do framed as a paper document. ;-)

## Saint Paulâ€™s School ~ The School Prayer

I recited the following prayer frequently during mu six years at Saint Paul's School. Many years later I was reminded of it. Atheist as I am, I still find its petition and reminders resonates well with my mission in life.

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."
