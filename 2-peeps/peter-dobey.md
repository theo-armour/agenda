Goldfinger
He's the man, the man with the Midas touch
A spider's touch
Such a cold finger
Beckons you to enter his web of sin
But don't go in

Goldmirror
He's the man, the man withe the mirror touch
A an artists touch
Beckons you to enter his wall of sin
But don't go in

### Artist Collaborative

Midjourney Concept

* Perhaps built using Discord
* Build scenes on demand
* Office hours

Alternative Concept

* See also technology and user experience demonstrated on Chaturbate
* Thumbnails display the style of TikTok video the artist produces
* Could even be the the latest public video the artist has produced


### “Magic mirror, on the wall – who is the fairest one of all?”

Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
Who in this land is fairest of all?

The mission is to create the magic mirror for you. A place where you can see yourself as you are and as you want to be. A place where you can see yourself as others see you. A place where you can see yourself as you will be in the future. And every time: it's your choice


## 2023-09-05

Mood mirrors

* Type in a mood and be immersed in a multi-dimensional mirror
* Take a selfie and be immersed in a multi-voice song
* Sing a song and be immersed in an explosion of imagery

Create an original TikTok video that reflects upon who you are right now

Request bespoke concierge-enabled selfies

You want to be drinking PBR and eating PBJs in the middle of the the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. We can arrange this

On porn sites you can request "workers" to perform specific acts. We can do the same for you. You want to be in a hot tub with a bunch of naked people? We can arrange this.

And we can do it all in a way that is safe, sane and consensual.

And if you want to be strolling through Fantasyland with ponies and kittens, we can arrange this too.

Hello Peter

PyschArtistry


My daughter wants us to create mult-dimensional experience using text prompts that describe one's current mood.

Hi Alix

I'm on the case.

My psychoanalyst (school of Jacques Lacan) friend Peter Dobey sent me this message the other day:

To all I have chosen to involve: bonne journée,

It brings me pleasure to introduce this collaborative collection of individuals for which intuition acts as the origin of avant-gardism: that is, those at the forefront of savouring the precipice of mortality, but for whom have no wish to die too soon: I propose a start-up (the medium of our epoch) for which the formalization of a 21st century presentation of the aesthetic as experience can find its grounding principles. (Please take note of the email hierarchy, for I never speak or write metaphorically)

As you are all aware, the first phase is how to approach Simco, as a Saint would approach the devil. Robert Groome falls into the same category.

This shall all be expanded upon. With roles closer to a position we could deem as having the namesake of being thus specified:

May I forward your Google doc to inspire this new artistic collaboration?

Love,

Daddy

http://paulgraham.com/smart.html

* The importance of having new ideas
* Numbers of smart people achieve little
* Imagine you had a choice between being really smart but discovering nothing new, and being less smart but discovering lots of new ideas. Surely you'd take the latter.
* Having new ideas is such a new thing historically, and even now done by so few people, that society hasn't yet assimilated the fact that this is the actual destination, and intelligence merely a means to an end.
* One of the most surprising ingredients in having new ideas is writing ability. There's a class of new ideas that are best discovered by writing essays and books.


Me

* not psychotic
* normally neurotic
* mostly appropriate behaviors / affects
* Function at a fairly high level
* A ton of expressed desires ~ attainable and unobtainable / dreams and fantasies
* Stress, anxiety, worry: minimal
* My fundemental fantasy: there are others out there whom I will love
* Will analysis unleash creativity

Me

* Seeking chatty peeps
* Source of projects, possible collaborator
* Could be several people

Fantasy

* The barn at Ressons

### 2021-10-22

* no writing, no replies, no new data
* Me as the teacher always; nobody teaching me; am I my best teacher or mentor
* Julia Morgan: My buildings speak for themselves. Me: I must speak for my failures.
* virtues & vices
* Why see an analyst?
* All I want|wanted was somebody to talk to
* nice, smart person quite dedicated to the task at hand
* Call it one of my few “successes”
* Peter as yet another fantasy- intellectual alter ego
* Actually I am not trying to cure some pain, all I am seeking is a bit of fun/stimulation

Alternative
* https://www.drbabbel.com/

Who can I talk to about being so happy?

Fink is wonderful

What are my desires?

 If I do have a desire, it is to be more like me

Continuing with Peter would become boring. VBit if he is just a mirror, then I am boring. ;-)

* revelation of unconscious desire and previously unavowed enjoyment


### 2021-10-16

Fink p115

> He thought of himself as wanting a total relationship with a woman: she would be his lover, best friend, soulmate, and intellectual alter ego - in short, someone with whom he could share everything.

### 2021-10-15

Super Audition
* https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330730605_On_Lacan_and_Supervision_A_Matter_of_Super-Audition

Mext session: "second subjectivity" "super-audition"

It is a matter of hearing the ever-surprising symbolic dimension of speech beyondwhat we presume to know already. When the analyst starts to get the idea of knowingwhat the patient is going to say, it’s time to consult a supervisor

* Talk about Peter: What I see, what I hear what I feel, what I sense
* If Peter is the mirror who I gaze at, then it too has a post-processor (me reflecting upon the mirror)
* My talking about castration and vulva (vagina) was done with "jouissance"

### 2021-09-28

Lacan & Groome

* The map is bigger than the territory
* You need to go through a priest to get to god
* Euler notation
* Triadic thinking ~ add Borromean rings
* The drawing is more important than the building
* The process of curing is more important than health
* Therapy vs wellness
* Incomplete Nature ~ Terrance Deacon
* Are we looking at the map or are we looking at the territory? Sometimes it can be hard to tell
* McLuhan ~ and Groome's orality

***

What do I want, what is it I miss in my relationships?

* Ongoing dialogs on multiple topics
* Topics include arts & letters, technology, health and so on
* complicated but not too
* Written and oral
* Remote and partying
* Occasional projects or collaborations
* Somehow productive and useful and beneficial

Also

* That things are revealed, observations, insights, intuitions
* That the processes of improv, design thinking, empathy is understood and observed
* Need to identify the relevant aspects of the 24 virtues

The Gaze

I want my daughters to be normal American daughters

I want my daughters to be special - in other words: not normal

This results in a Bateson double bind

In psychoanalysis, the problem with discussing virtues is that there are so few problems.

This, in turn, may behoove psychoanalysis - as it moves from therapy to wellness - to focus on - of all things: happiness!

You: A problem with Lacanian analysis is that there is no established methodology.

Me:Ah hah! I see that there is a problem that needs solving. Can we discuss some of the issues?

## What started it

https://kk.org/cooltools/tangoesarduino-cloneuppercase/

>**How to find the right therapist**
Here is some great advice on how to find the right therapist. One of the first steps is to figure out what kind of therapeutic framework you need. When I first started therapy I had anxiety that sometimes resulted in panic attacks. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy taught me how to redirect a thought so that it doesn’t create overwhelming feelings that would affect my behavior. Now, 8 years later, I have a person-centered therapist that I talk to about all aspects of my life. Each session feels like I’m catching up with my very insightful and intelligent friend who I can vent to and ask for advice. I always tell my friends that you are allowed to break up with your therapist if the fit isn’t right. I saw three therapists before I found my most recent one, who I’ve been seeing for three years now. Finding the “right therapist” feels like you’ve acquired a super power. — CD
