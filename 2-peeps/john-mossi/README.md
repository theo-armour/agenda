Summary with a contemporary spin

* We heart Spiderman
* Jesus woulda, coulda; but he's no superhero wannabe
* Rather, Jesus is the community organizer
* Jesus partners with disciples of all genders. All are called - even you and me.
* Jesus is not rugged solitary woodsman. Jesus is the ringleader of a team of good peeps,
* Jesus tries isolation - to fulfill the prophecy - but he chooses urbanity
* Jesus needs help - not just a selected few buddies but all of us - and you too!
* Prefers effective and engaging collaboration. Can you do this?
* We/you can be the blood vessels
* Fingers crossed: we/you receive the grace that enables the vessels to fill
* Don't forget though, Jesus is the decider!
* Pray that we/you receive the grace so that healing occurs. And the mission continues to boldly go.
