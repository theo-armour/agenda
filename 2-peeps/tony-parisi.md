Tony: Nice to hear from you! FB is for old folks. t.armour@gmail.com is for coders like me and 415 828 0000 is for me and my daughters on whatsapp.
I am trying to work out my five-year plan. So many of my 3D, geospatial, interactive design ideas of ten years ago have come into fruition and are being processed by the young. I must not ever compete against my older self. And now with AI, it's all new. The playing field is level again.
