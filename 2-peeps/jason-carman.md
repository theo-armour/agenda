## 2023-11-19 ~ discover the hover

Hi Jason,

Consider plenty of white space and information showing up on the fly

Hover is a good tool for this. And it's in all the browsers

Example with very dense realtime information

https://alltop.com

Try it yourself ~ scroll down and play with the several examples

An alternative is to use "Link popins" that show up when you first click on a link

https://gwern.net/

Click on links in "newest" and "Popular"

BTW, gwern is a very smart person

PS Figma and Canva are good tools for building yesterday's websites

Hi Jason

I have difficulty finding

Consistent links would be good

Yes.A name is a good idea.

### Website without links is like a car without wheels

* links to the organizations you mention
* links to their linkedIn, TechCrunch, Crunchbase, AngelList, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, GitHub, Medium, Substack, etc
* The most useful possible resource for that entity
* The first draft of their wikipedia page. ;-)


### Features & Benefits

* What is the problem you are solving?
* What is the solution you are offering?
* What is the value proposition?

* What is the traction to date?

## AI: Where to focus?

I find it interesting that you plan to jump into AI by diving into deep learning, while I plan to get the broadest and trend-following view by including Large Language Models.

This may well be because we read different technical media.

* Feeds from Substack and Medium

I also end to left swipe my Samsung phone to get "random" news items from Google News

What tops your frequent media diet?
