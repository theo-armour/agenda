Hi Santani

So on Tuesday, Cludia and I are meeting at my storage units. Her emails and thinking appear totally organized. I really look forward to our meeting..

Last week I had a UTI and was in bed for a few days. I am feeling better now. But still skipping alcohol until antibiotics are done on the 10th.

See you after that?

Oh, Happy Day!

Santani
Yesterday evening was a delight. Thank you! More about it all another time. For now:
The most depressing aspect of my personal cosmology, is the acceptance that entropy happens—that eventually everything melts, thaws and resolves itself into some kind of metaphysical poo.

{Much text could be inserted here regarding the absurdity of life}

A few days ago, a paper was published that posits a "law of increasing functional information". I have started double-clicking on this idea. My brain is saying: "Entropy is your friend". The path of least resistance. The descent of gradient vectors. "Claude Shannon is your friend" and other silly thoughts.

As entropy increases the number of possible states increases, so perhaps: The number of possible states is a measure of the information content of a system. The number of possible states is a measure of the complexity of a system. The number of possible states is a measure of the functional information of a system. The functional information of a system increases as entropy increases.

So, it's all going down the drain, but it's going down the drain in an interesting way. Thus, offering pain meds for an ailing personal cosmology.

Forgive me for dumping a stream of consciousness on you. I do hope you have a look at the paper. I will be pleased to hear your observations.

lab studies: Can I participate? Or am I too old.


### Questions

When I hear a sound, my head and eyes may turn toward the sound. Is this a reflex or a learned behavior? Do blind people exhibit this behavior - particularly with reference to their eyes?

### Plasticity of the brain

If I follow David Allen, GTD author, and get everything out of my brain,do I have more brain to tackle the next thing?

Does forgetting things free up resources for doing new things?

If I don;t have to remember phone numbers and addresses do I have more brain to do other things?
