Dear Chloe and Daniel

For two selfish reasons I am declining your kind invitation to attend your September reception in person: I plan to devote the time to my EverEverLand startup and to continue with my effort to go back down to the 180 pounds I weighed when I moved to Heritage on the Marina. Please forgive.

On the other hand. It would be awesome to attend the your reception in a digital manner. Of course there are may ways of doing this. Nonetheless, it seems to me that with your knowledge and connections there could be much more than (or along with) a webcam and Zoom session.

In my dreams I see one or more Twitch pros with cameras participating and broadcasting live backed up by an offsite direction/production team. In particular. I would like to provide thoughts and observations on planning and preparing for a live event documentation process that generates - along with laughter and mirth - meaningful and fulfilling content .

For millennia the vows of marriages have been prescribed and and recorded. On the other hand, for millennia few of the wishes and thoughts of the congregations of witnesses have been recorded. As we are learning in this era, audiences has much to share and many good comments. Is it not time that the witnesses to one of life's most important commitments be enabled to speak and be heard!

Please let me know if such an effort would be welcomed, doable and programmable. If so, I will be delighted to be a sponsor/backer in such a project.
