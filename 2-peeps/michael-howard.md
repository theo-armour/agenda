* The San Francisco Civic Center.
* A history of the design, comma, controversies, comma, and realization of a city. Beautiful masterpiece.
* By James W Haas
* orward by Senator Dianne Feinstein.
* 2019

Michael gave me his copy of the book. A couple of weeks ago. Period. It is signed by James Haas and dedicated to somebody named Thom.

Haas view:

* >the grandest collection of monumental municipal buildings in the United States,
* >one of the most complete developments envisioned by any American city.
* >one of the finest achievements of the American reformist City Beautiful movement,"

My view:

Haas' observations are all valid. Nonetheless

Today

* The area is a homeless encampment
* There is no reason to hang out there except for business
* Whats is is the beauty of a huge empty spaces?
* If architecture, as Goethe opined, is "frozen music",`then the Civic Center is a dirge
