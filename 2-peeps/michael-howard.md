Hi Michael

Thank you for he San Francisco Civic Center. I have leafed through it and it is a beautiful book and noted Haas's signature. I am wondering whether to look at it more closely. If I do so it will be with the digital edition, so I have donated the book to the Stucky Library on your behalf.

My thoughts:

Haas view regarding the Civic Center:

* >the grandest collection of monumental municipal buildings in the United States
* >one of the most complete developments envisioned by any American city
* >one of the finest achievements of the American reformist City Beautiful movement

I can agree with all of these observations. Nonetheless, today:

* The area is a homeless encampment
* There is no reason to hang out there except for business (or a performance involving paying money)
* What is the beauty of a huge empty spaces?
* If architecture, as Goethe opined, is "frozen music",`then the Civic Center is a dirge

Haas view:

* >one of the most complete developments envisioned by any American city.
* >one of the finest achievements of the American reformist City Beautiful movement,"

My view:

Haas' observations are all valid. Nonetheless

Today

* The area is a homeless encampment
* There is no reason to hang out there except for business
* Whats is is the beauty of a huge empty spaces?
* If architecture, as Goethe opined, is "frozen music",`then the Civic Center is a dirge
