* Jon saved my life
* Not figuratively, literally
* On April 15, 1969, while at Syracuse University
* I was flying a kite on the roof of our dormitory
* Jan was watching
* Jon saw the kite take a big dip.
* Jon looked for me, I was not there.
* Jon went over to the low parent and looked down
* At a twisted mass of skin, bones and blood
* If Jon had not been there to call 911, I'd be dead
