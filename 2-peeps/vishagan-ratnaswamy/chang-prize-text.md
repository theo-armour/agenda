**Current Employment
Company/Organization**

```
IQLAND Innovations
```
**Current Job Title** Fractional Chief Technical Officer and Visiting Researcher

**Describe your current job and work related responsibilities.**

```
My job responsibilities as a Fractional CTO at IQLAND Innovations was primarily centered around research and development
of an AI system that is geared towards helping small towns tackle urban challenges such as their zoning code as well as
streamlining their infrastructure. This role is primarily focused on applying methods in AI as well as geo-spatial data modeling
to consolidate these towns that are primarily black and do not have the infrastructure to drive in more residents.
Additionally, I am a visiting researcher at New Jersey Institute of Technology where I work in the Granular Science
Laboratory. In this capacity, I conduct research into computational models directed at simulation soft matter as well as
present at conferences. My scope in both as a fractional CTO and visiting researcher is to conduct scientific research as well
as collaborating with the contractors of IQLAND Innovations to develop engineering aspects of the AI platform. Now that
the AI platform is finished, I now just have meetings and check in her e and there while the CEO is meeting with cities and
selling it to them. My position as a visiting research scientist has always been very flexible as I do research but it is at my own
pace and it is also how I am able to balance it with my other commitments, especially being a fractional CTO.
```
**Describe the new career path you are interested in exploring.**


```
A new career path that I am very much interested in exploring lies at the forefront of educational and professional
opportunities for foster youth in urban cities--specifically in San Francisco CA, the city that I live in.. This path is aimed at
working with Foster youth services and helping youth both navigate their educational opportunities post-high school but
also what is available to them after they turn 21. This path is important to me because while there is support that is available
through foster youth services such both program-wise such as CASA and ILSP which give resources such as a mentor and
services such as resume writing and tutoring. However, these services are not sufficient for foster youth (primarily that are
primarily of various ethnic backgrounds as well as part of the LGBTQIQA+) communities. I know this personally because I am
working with foster youth as a tutor since September 2023 to currently across middle and high school. This work has not just
been recent, but I had been a volunteer at School on Wheels when I was a graduate student at Caltech, that included me
being a volunteer at Hillsides Homes for boys that were in middle and high school. My primary focus will be to bring these
services to children that are in foster youth services that may or may not be reuniting with their families but also with those
that are marginalized, especially trans youths.

**Summarize your proposed project.**

```
My proposed project involves working with social workers San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) and SF foster youth
services. This project involves working both with addressing the needs of the students within the educational environment,
which means amassing volunteers that work the SF foster youth services interns that are at each school (middle and high
school) and facilitating tutor programs with them. This will first be done through myself as a tutor through both individual
and group sessions. However, I will work with the interns with engaging the community to have retired professionals work
with students throughout the day. The second part of the project works with students that are transitioning to college as
there is not necessarily a plan if they want to move away from SF and go to schools further away. I intend to work with SF
foster youth services, the social workers of the foster youth as well as the SF CASA (court appointed special advocates) to
create a way so that foster care youth that are attending college or trade school both in SF or outside of SF have the proper
support whether this is virtual or through local organizations. The last part of the project is making sure to leverage my
network to at foster collaboration with the tech community, that is internships through startups as well as research projects
where foster youth can work on and present their projects at conferences that will build their confidence.
```
**Project Description, Goals, and Objectives:**
Provide a detailed explanation (including clear goals and objectives) of what you intend to accomplish with your project.

```
The goals that I intend to accomplish in this project are in multiple phases. The first phase involves engaging in the middle
and high school level of identifying students in foster care that are falling behind and addressing those needs. To do that, I
will work with SF foster youth services and their interns as well as SFUSD to come up with a comprehensive plan to address
which students have fallen behind and those who are are risk of dropping out. As someone who as has worked and is
volunteering at SFUSD with foster youth, I am able to reach out to social workers in middle and high school at SFUSD to see
what those needs are and immediately get to addressing where the students are falling behind. The next step is to engage
the community and that means working with the Wellness Center and social workers to recruit others (students in the local
colleges as well as retired professionals) to come in and work with foster care youth so that they are caught up. With this, we
can establish a cadence where foster youth can build long-standing relationship with adults that they can depend on that
can go beyond the classroom and into mentor-ship. The next phase would be to have workshops led by the foster youth
interns that allows them to share knowledge about how to better serve the youth that they are serving. This is important as
it can go a long way in distilling the information that unfortunately is not readily available to share among themselves as
they are busy and inundated with serving youth across the city. It has been shared with me with a foster youth intern that I
```

```
worked with while tutoring students at multiple schools during the 2023-2024 school year that those workshops allows for
best practices to allow for a compilation of information that spreads across working with students across multiple ethnicities
as well as gender identities as those issues do vary. Furthermore, in this phase I myself will be working with SF foster youth
services and SFUSD on applying for grants within the states to service schools where they can better provide adequate
educational and after school services for foster care students. Unfortunately, SFUSD has undergone many budget cuts
where school programs have been removed, so it is imperative that there are alternative means such as grants that can be
endowed upon schools within the district that can serve its most vulnerable students. In this phase, I will be focused on
engaging the school administration on what programs that can best serve foster youth within their schools and then write
grants so that they can implement such programs. Furthermore, within this phase, I will work with grassroots organizations
such as Lavender Phoenix that works on behalf of non-binary and transgender people so that they can work with foster-care
students that identify as non-binary and transgender in order to provide them with the resources so that they can thrive. In
the last phase of this project, I will set up programs, so that foster care students can engage in both research in an academic
setting through myself and the local universities in the area such as USF, SFSU and NJIT so that they can gain experience in
an academic setting if they choose to attend universities. Furthermore, I will leverage my network so that foster care
students can have internships at startups in the SF tech scene so that they can be exposed to what working in this space is
like as most do not have the confidence nor feel like they belong in those spaces.
```
**Intended Outcomes and Societal Impact:**
Describe your intended outcomes and how your project has the potential to make a meaningful and positive impact on
society.

```
My intended outcomes of this project is to ultimately empower foster youth across different ethnicities and gender
identities so that they feel like they belong in spaces that they did not think they would fit in. Societally, foster youth have
been marginalized as they have had to deal with issues of abandonment and homelessness. This has led to a very low
graduation rate from high school and an even lower enrollment rate of college. My goal of this project is to make sure that
they have the resources at their disposal that will allow them to succeed, but also empower them to know that they belong
in places higher learning. Furthermore, it is my goal of engaging the community, especially the academic and tech
community to care and provide an environment where foster youth can thrive.
```
**New Career Experiences & Professional Development:**
What will you learn by embarking on this project? What new career experiences do you expect to have? Which skills will you
develop or improve by completing this project?

```
What I will learn by embarking on this project are where the deficiencies are in the infrastructure that serve foster youth. This
knowledge will be gathered both at the city level with the foster youth services as well as at the educational level with the
school administrators will allow me to better work with schools and foster youth services as they do not have the resources
to address foster students at the granular level. Furthermore, the additional skills I want to develop would be creating
infrastructure that integrates both on the macro-level with administrators in foster youth services as well as on the granular
level within the school. What I have found volunteering at middle and high schools in SFUSD is that while those policies are
there for foster youth, they are not readily accessible nor do the foster students know of them till it is too late. Therefore,
understanding why these types of infrastructures that are in place fail to make their way to foster youth and how this can be
remedied at a granular level would be the key skill that I would want to develop out of this project. An important career
experience I want to have for this project would be to work with the city in what they need to better address the issues that
foster youth face both in their day to day lives as well as provide a better framework that enables foster youth to pursue
higher education.

**Statement of Need:**
How will the Chang Prize funds allow you to accomplish what you would otherwise not have been able to do on your own?

```
The Chang Prize will allow me to accomplish this project that otherwise I could not have done on my own because I will be
able to use those funds to deliberately work on this project and take a break from my work from before. These funds would
be used to help understand the deficiencies in the infrastructures that serve foster youth in addition to allowing myself to
work with the interns that directly serve foster youth within SFUSD. The funds from the Chang Prize would allow me to go
beyond my volunteer work as I can now devote time to work with the key administrators in the schools such as counselors
and the wellness staff at the granular level in order to address the students needs that are often forgotten. Furthermore,
working with grassroots organizations within SF that are focused on bringing equity to those that are marginalized will allow
me to better help foster youth as well as include the community within SF that are wanting to help foster youth.
Furthermore, working with grassroots organizations within SF will allow me to use my experience in which I have worked on
grants in an scientific setting and apply it to getting funding to help build infrastructure and programs to serve foster youth.
Taking this break to focus on this project will allow me to now devote time to work on grant writing to gain funding so that
foster youth can better be served.
