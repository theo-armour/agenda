# 2025-06-15 Project Summary

Vishagan’s year-long project will support marginalized foster youth in San Francisco—especially youth of color and LGBTQIA+ identities—through academic support, career preparation, and community engagement. It bridges education, civic support services, grassroots advocacy, and the tech sector.

## Three Key Points to Share with Vish

### 1. Your Story Is a Strategic Asset

Your personal involvement with foster youth (past and present) sets you apart.

Use your narrative strategically: people fund people as much as projects.

Encourage more visible storytelling, especially in grant writing and partnerships.

### 2. Refine Your Focus for Early Wins

The project spans tutoring, mentorship, internships, grant writing, and policy outreach.

Choose one or two high-impact pilot initiatives to concentrate on first (e.g., after-school tutoring and tech internships).

Focus will help demonstrate early results and attract ongoing support.

### 3. You’re a Cross-Domain Connector

You uniquely link engineering, AI, social equity, and education—this is rare.

Use your network (Caltech, NJIT, SF tech/startup community) to prototype systems that support social change, not just services.

Start documenting a long-term vision—what might this become in 3–5 years?
