Hi Dr Kattah

Some thoughts from way back when:

Endiatx

The world’s first low-cost, disposable, remote-controlled, high-quality endoscopy pill.

We talked of this start-up but I don't know if I ever sent you a link: https://endiatx.com/

GitHub

If you ever have to do more stuff on GitHub here are some suggestions to help people find you:

* Star and follow others - and yourself - on GitHub
* Add link to images or posters to your readme files on GitHub
* Add tags to your repos on GitHub
* Add links to the relevant published articles to the readme on GitHub
* Add links to GitHub in your X or LinkedIn

And I like - and mostly follow - these thoughts

ChatGPT 03-mini  says:

Here are a few rib-tickling, playful responses imagining a "colonoscopy" for a large language model:

The Data Flush:
"Before we insert the scope, we give the model a data flush—clearing out all the outdated bytes so its layers are squeaky clean. No garbage in, garbage out!"

Neural Navel-Gazing:
"Instead of examining colon polyps, we’re scanning for pesky 'neuron knots' in the model. Who knew artificial neurons could get as tangled as headphone cords in your pocket?"

Attention Span Check:
"The procedure involves using an 'attention map' to check if the model’s focus is as sharp as a surgeon’s scalpel. 'Excuse me, model, are you paying attention here or just stringing me along?'"

Debugging Digestion:
"After the procedure, we run a full digestion test to ensure every byte is processed correctly—because even a language model can have an 'indigestion' of bad data!"

Modeloscopy Makeover:
"We call it a 'modeloscopy'—the ultimate makeover. We inspect every layer, adjust the parameters, and by the end, the model's not only healthier, it’s practically a supermodel!"

Each of these responses plays with the analogy of a medical colonoscopy and translates it into the quirks of maintaining and debugging a large language model. Enjoy the playful imagery and the pun-filled take on model maintenance!
