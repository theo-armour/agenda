Talks about different ways of considering the calendar

Mike's work is about considering dozens of calendars. If every email has its own calendars then we have millions of calendars.

### View

A row of "pages" standing vertically on top of a landscape. Each page represents a tim slot. Week, day, hour, minute - whatever the user wants. The lanscape shows a map with areas representing courts, offices and other locations of interest
Every person has a box. Beneath each box is a row of icons representing emails, calls, text and meetings. Above the box there might be a row of icons signifying other things.

The persons box moves from office to couurt to other

As you mouse over the pages, tthe pages seprate to enable a clear view of the currently selected page.

Hi Mike

I am still in the process of digesting your paper. I really like it. I can envisage uses outside the domain of law.

You are covering in seven pages what might eventually take dozens of pages to cover in detail. In the meantime, I could ask dozens of questions.  But I think it would be better to wait until you have a chance to flesh out your ideas a bit more.

In the meantime,

Is there any particular aspect or section where you would like some feedback, further research or questioning?

And, here are some of my "deliverables":

## Terence Deacon ~ _Incomplete Nature_

This is the book I mentioned while we were talking about _Sapiens_

One of the most complicated books I ever read - by a very smart author. In some ways it presages the gradient descent of large language models. Unfortunately it did not build up the following I hoped for - and that I hoped I could use my 3D skills to illustrate.

* Incomplete Nature ~ https://www.amazon.com/Incomplete-Nature-Mind-Emerged-Matter-ebook/dp/B005LW5JAS

## David Graeber and Davide Wengrow ~ _The Dawn of Everything_

Upon reflection, Dawn of Everything probable offers a better way to think about the law than Deacon's or Harari's books.  It is a much easier read, and it is more directly relevant to the law.  It is also a much more controversial book. And it's a great read.

Current historiography is a myth. Accounts of human history:

1. Simply aren't true
2. Have dire political implications
3. Make the past needlessly dull ~ Actually more playful

## Three Laws||Pillars of Observability

Observability is a term of art in the software industry.  It is a way of thinking about the behavior of complex systems. It seems to be quite a big thing in the software industry.  I think it may also useful as a way of thinking about and observing the law. Id so then, there's code, guidelines, and a community to draw on.
