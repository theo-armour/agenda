>>Don't forget, beyond RPS there are any number of servers which can be receiving the event stream for their objects and implementing (and offering) any git-style functionality they want.

Bingo!

Create the schema for the API. ;-)


### DNS/RFC

>> I can certainly write things up at that level, but my sense is it's too early to publish an RFC.

Agreed. An RFC most like the result of much email traffic where the author has been hounded by others to write it up. ;-)

>>Given that, if I downplay AR (unless directly addressing that audience), does the text work.

Nope. Your paper is about a dime-store app. Please put "changing the world" on the table. [Words are too harsh but good wake-up value]

### AR vs AI

>> I think there's more life to AR than you think

I'm not sure. I have lived in a 3D-computed world since I first tried multiplying matrices on punch card FORTRAN

## History

>> The question here is what facilities to build on top of the **event** stream and where to place them in the architecture.

Bingo!

## Apps vs RFC

>> This validates the idea of going to industry rather than the traditional Angel/VC route.

Bingo!

Or are Wall, Van Rossum, Torvalds, Berners-Lee, Gosling, Kernighan & Ritchie more your style?

I have your Ambient Web Abstract paper. Do you have any documents that describe the Ambient Web in more detail?

Do you have a working demo?

Asked: Does your schema allow for vector databases?

## 2023-11-10

In the future, it's quite likely that many databases will incorporate vector-based approaches, similar to those used in large language models, especially for tasks involving complex data interpretation, searching, and pattern recognition. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Efficient Data Handling:** Vector-based systems, like those in large language models, can handle a vast array of data types more efficiently than traditional databases. This is especially true for unstructured data like text, images, and complex data patterns.

2. **Advanced Search Capabilities:** Vector tokens allow for more nuanced and contextual searches. This can be particularly useful in fields like medical research, legal databases, or any area where contextual understanding adds value to search results.

3. **AI and Machine Learning Integration:** The future of databases is closely tied to AI and machine learning. Vector-based systems are inherently more compatible with these technologies, allowing for more sophisticated data analysis and predictive modeling.

4. **Real-time Data Processing:** As businesses and technologies move towards real-time decision-making, the ability of vector-based systems to quickly process and analyze large volumes of data becomes increasingly valuable.

5. **Scalability and Flexibility:** Vector-based databases can scale more effectively as data volume grows, and they are generally more flexible in terms of the types of data they can handle and the kinds of queries they can support.

However, there will still be scenarios where traditional databases are preferred, particularly for structured data and situations where the complexity and resource demands of vector-based systems are not justified. The choice between traditional and vector-based databases will depend on specific use cases, data types, and resource considerations.
