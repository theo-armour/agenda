# 2025-04-27 Disclosures

Hello everyone,

TL;Dr: scroll down and click to the Google Photos link to see me dancing on stage at a rock concert. ;-)

I have flung my hat into the ring to be elected to the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society. As with any politics, it's not just the polemics that matter, but also the disclosures. 

My opponent refuses to sign the current non-disclosure agreement and yet is unwilling to share here phone number and email.

As most of you know, I am the opposite. My door is always open.

So in order to maintain my long-standing ability of complexify almost anything. I shared the following message with residents and a few members of staff.

Enjoy!
