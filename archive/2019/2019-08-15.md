So here I am on a flight to Detroit. 

There is some Internet, but not for chromebooks.

So I am just going to type stuff and see what happens.

I was planning to read about Detroit histpry using Wikipedia, but no access.


## Life 

So I have let life become too complicated it seems. 

* Spider
* Simplicity
* Archiving
* My health
* Family / Costa Rica
* GGTA
* Peeps to talk to
* Just living

Is a lot

Mark Carranza and PatrickM are being disappointing.

## wework

And wework meetup yesterday was fun but so disappointing

John Grogg / WeWork sotware effort

* Proprietary
* Closed source
* Heavy dev-ops
* Needs full-stack / much expertise
* No export / online sharing
* API??


Can I build a demo of a FOSS access to a subset of the ww data? Why?

* Embed a model in my website
* Deliver my proprietary services to a wework location
* Scrape and reuse wework data in an authorized manner


## gbXML / Stephen Roth

* Meetup
* Complimentary efforts
* Vision of the future
* Wework connection
* Autodesk connection
