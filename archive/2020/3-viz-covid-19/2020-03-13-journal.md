## Post to TGD

The post was written over the weekend. Since then, times have changed.

Note that the current day's numbers ( the bar on the right ) are not final until it is midnight in Hawaii or Guam or wherever. Check this link for updated results: Tracking Every Coronavirus Case

The new new thing is that the CDC is recommending in areas where there are minimal to moderate cases that "Individuals at increased risk of severe illness should consider staying at home and avoiding gatherings or other situations of potential exposures, including travel."

"OK boomer" here, single and disabled.The CDC warning is directed at me. And I am wealthy and free to do whatever.

Should I rent a car and go to Idaho or places that have no cases for the next six months? Or should I stay here and use my Internet skills to help the oldsters in my 'hood?

In either case, there will be follow ups to the post because:

It turns out that the best page of charts to track the emergence of COVID-19 is built and maintained by a high-school senior in Kong Kong!

## 2020-03-13 ~ Walk before you run ~ Practicing for a self-quarantine ~ Day One

Hello world-in-a-pandemic

## Off we go
Today I start a practice self-quarantine. I plan to stay isolated in my apartment for a week.

I probably do not really need to self-quarantine for a while. Fingers crossed I never need to.  But if and when the need occurs, do I want to be self-quarantined without practicing for it first?

During this period, it will be a good test to see if I do the following:

* Get food and drink
* Access other needed supplies
* Enough exercise
* Dispose of garbage
* Get laundry done
* Socialize
* Be productive
* Access some vitamin D

## OK Boomer, Why do this?

Just like any boomer, I have lived through two Kennedy assassinations, plagues of locusts, an oil crises or two, Y2K, 9/11, more recessions than I can count and whatever. For all intents and purposes, for my generation, the COVID-19 pandemic is merely yet another crisis that you just grin and bear until passes. You just say "well, there's nothing I can do about this" and you about your daily business.

Or not.

If you do happen to read about "Flattening the Coronavirus Curve" and you understand the message, you will get it that there is something that can be done to help the world through the pandemic - but only if most of us do it. And it's not that hard to wrap your brain around. All we have to do is increase our "social distance" for a while.

For most post-boomer generations there's enough of a life via texting, Facebook and Twitter that increasing social distance is a doable proposition. But for my "I love the smell of paper", "I can't remember the password" boomer generation not being able to touch others is like spilling a glass of gin on the deck of cards. It totally disrupts the game we're playing.

My goals

* Show you kids, that some boomers do get it
* Use to advantage the privileges that I have been given: the time, funds and place to do it
* Accept the challenge to take a sucky situation and see if there's any whimsy in it

I plan to write about my many adventures along the way - and warn you about the pitfalls if you ever have to make the same treacherous journey.
