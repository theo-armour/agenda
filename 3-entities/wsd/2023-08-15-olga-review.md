Hello WebSightDesigners

Hello WebSightDesigners

I'm sorry for being slow on providing you with AI updates

Noah has called for a Board of Directors meeting today, so It's high time to produce.

The first thing to note is that the heat is off. See this Google Trends report:

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2012-07-15%202023-08-15&geo=US&q=5g,uber,chatgpt,AI&hl=en

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2015-01-01%202023-07-13&q=%2Fm%2F01kl97,metaverse,virtual%20reality,chagpt&hl=en

What the media like to talk about and what is actually happening are two different things. As you can see, the media has moved on to other topics. The trend for "chatGPT is falling as fast as it rose. And the trend for AI is falling as well.

This done mot mean "game over". Several things of interest are happening:

1. Investors are throwing money at AI startups.

Example: https://venturebeat.com/ai/report-ai-investments-see-largest-year-over-year-growth-in-20-years/

2. AI is already exploding some industries

* Education
* Stock photos
* Stack overflow and Q&A sites

3. "Generative AI" (GAI), "large language model" (LLM) and "in-context learning" are hot topics

"in-context learning" is a new term for "transfer learning". It is a hot topic because it is a way to get around the need for large amounts of training data. ChatGPT is a LLM

It turns out that if you gather a good amount of related questions together on topics that a LLM has never been trained on, the LLM can begin to answer them. This outcome was never anticipated by the researchers who developed LLMs. It is a surprise. Moreover, researchers still do not understand why it works.

In other words, AI is getting better faster than expected. And people still do not understand why.

The number of research papers with new insights and new tools that improve the performance of LLMs is exploding. Many include source code.

Where do these and all the other trends impact WSD?

I don't think many clients will be knocking at the door saying "Please ma'am can I have some more AI?"

## Plugins everywhere

But I do think that AI will be a part of many projects. For example, a client may want to add a chatbot to their site. Or they may want to add a search feature that is better than the one they have now. My guess is that you will bwe able to add these as available Laravel plugins.

## Many more answers

It will be far easier to get opinions such "from the point of view the chief strategist at compass.com, how will AI transform the real estate industry? And how will that affect the web presence of local realtors?"

## Picking the right tools: Yikes!!!

There is so much going, finding the right "horses to bet on" is going to be a challenge.
