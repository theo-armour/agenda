Essential criteria for a mailing list include

* Free
* Multi user admin so that I and others can work together
* Experience gained can be used again in other projects

Here are two services - both with a ton of features - to consider:

https://groups.io/static/features

* Like a forum, allows replies, clients can view previous messages
* Has calendars, wiki etc for registered users

https://www.mailerlite.com/compare

* Like MailChimp - but MailChimp free is single seat only
* Announcement only
* Provides "landing pages" available to anybody with link
