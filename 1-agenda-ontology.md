# Admin Ontology

tags #admin #ontology #agenda #2023


## Concept

* How do I organize my lists of agendas, to-dos and notes?
* See also Wikipedia categories
* See also Theo Armour Pages, Evernote, Gdrive, Dropbox, GitHub, etc

This could be a simple list of categories. Or it could be a more complex ontology.

The issues is: Why not let the categories take care of themselves?
