# 2024-12-16 Family Party

Hello everyone

Just outside and below my window is a nice little stone cottage. It's a lovely place for a party.

Would you like to party at the cottage?

The date could be December 26 or 27, from 5 pm onwards.

Cynthia A will help me with the party. The food could be a potluck with Christmas leftovers.

Please let me know if you would like to join in, and which date and time you prefer.

Hello everyone!

I’ve got a cute little stone cottage just below my window, and I’m thinking it’s the perfect spot for a cozy, after-Christmas gathering.

How about a party at the cottage? We could meet on December 26 or 27, starting around 5 pm and carrying on as long as we like. Cynthia A will be giving me a hand with getting things set up, and we thought a potluck spread of Christmas leftovers would be both delicious and fun!

Please let me know if you’re up for joining in and which date works best for you. Looking forward to celebrating with everyone!
