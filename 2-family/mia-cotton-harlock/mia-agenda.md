Hi Mia

At last, here are links to the two files with the notes for my soeeches at Cynthia's and Kyle's wedding.

* Groom's dinner talk
* Wedding talk

In one sense, I am proud of them, and in another sense I could laugh at them. In one way, they are typical of me saying the right thing at the wrong time. On the other hand. Sometimes it's good to say the right thing whenever. At least it's been said.

In any case, not to be forgotten is that they were written at one of the heights of the pandemic.

I'm looking forward to collaborating with you. Can I pay you via PayPal or Zelle? If so what email should I use?

I also look forward to lunch on Friday. Is noon OK? Wil it be just you and Cynthia?

Super Excuse me, it's, it's 4 awake. She said in the chair. She's in bed. OK, but she's awake. OK, OK, OK 1
