# 2024-12-16 Boxing Day

Hello family

I wanted to host a gathering on Boxing Day to help us all get together and celebrate the holidays. And, perhaps more important, share any surplus edible delights we have.

Unfortunately, I let the organization a bit late  and I'm not even going to try to pull it off.

Nonetheless, the idea is there; the seed has been planted. I have a charming little bit well-equipped venue at my disposal. Wait staff people are readily available in the neighborhood. I will do my research and see what I can come up with.

I will keep you posted. I look forward to hosting you all soon. In the meantime, any and all are invited for a meal at my house or anywhere nearby at any time.

Cheers and happy holidays

Theo
