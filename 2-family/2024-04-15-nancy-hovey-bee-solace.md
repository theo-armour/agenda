Dear Nancy

Allison shared the news of Bee's passing with Tania and me.

I am so sorry for your loss. I'm sorry we lost touch.

We had been in good contact until a few years ago. In my mind, Bee went from being a distant step brother to being a trusted financial manager to becoming a good friend.

My paralyzed legs and bowels make long distance travel difficult. I have not been able to visit you in a long time. I am sorry for that. And it also means that I cannot come to a memorial. Nonetheless if there is any way I can participate, please let me know.

I am thinking of you and sending you my love.

Theo
