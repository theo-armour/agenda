Hello Allison, Juliette and Aaron

I hope you are all well and dryish - raining and lightning now in San Francisco.

I look forward to seeing you all at this weekend! The weather forecast is for better weather.

How are your plans shaping up? I plan to join you at Boulevard for dinner on Thursday.

On Friday morning I have a Residents Council meeting but I will be free after that. Saturday and Sunday are open. The only thing is that I have the Heritage Happenings to get out to the proofreaders by Monday evening. It takes a good number of hours to get out. Getting the old people to finish their articles is like herding cats.

I also note that my walking still sucks and I continue to be a fall risk. We will play my activities by ear.

In any case, I look forward to a good discussion on Emily Wilson translation of The Iliad which I found to be a page turner and to offer biting insight on how the Western world became so patriarchal.
