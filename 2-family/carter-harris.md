Hi Carter

Thanks foe brining me into your loop!

I used chatGPT 4o mini to review your CV. The following two links are the chat logs of the review.

When I clicked on the "Sources" button, many more links appeared.

The prompts could use a lot of improving. I think you could have a great time exploring the possibilities for internships in the tech industry using AI.

Looking at your CV, it certainly good and dense. I'd like to see more links. Perhaps to your GitHub profile and links to any projects or organizations that have a web presence - especially the ones under additional projects.

If you are looking for fun companies to work for, here are some links to check out:

My question: what skills are you looking to acquire?

Cheers,

Theo
