# 2024-12-16 Boxing Day

Hello family,

I wanted to host a gathering on Boxing Day to help us all get together and celebrate the holidays. And, perhaps more importantly, share any surplus edible delights we have.

Unfortunately, I left the organization a bit late and I'm not even going to try to pull it off this year.

Nonetheless, the idea is there; the seed has been planted. I have a charming, well-equipped venue at my disposal. Wait staff are readily available in the neighborhood. I will do my research and see what I can come up with.

I will keep you posted. I look forward to hosting you all soon. In the meantime, any and all are invited for a meal at my house or anywhere nearby at any time.

Cheers and happy holidays,

Theo
