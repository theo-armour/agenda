Dear Alex,

What is the name of your condition? I'd like to Google it and chatGPT to see what I can learn about it.

Thank you for calling. In a strange way, it means a lot to me. Over the decades, I have dealt with pain on a number of occasions. The issue is that it's not a subject that people really want to talk about much. So talking to you about pain was kind of a release.

It was particularly useful because we could agree that pain is only half the issue. The other half is the the mental changes caused by pain - namely the anxiety and depression. In both of these I have much personal experience. And I can share aspects of a number of successful recoveries. I started writing about things - and writing and writing...

See below. The start of an article for Medium or Substack, perhaps...

Dealing with difficult recoveries

It was particularly useful talking to you because we could agree that pain is only half the issue. The other half is the the mental changes caused by pain - namely the anxiety and depression. In both of these I have much personal experience. And I can share aspects of coaxing a number of successful recoveries.

The first thing I should point out is that, up to now, I have been very lucky in ending up with so few ongoing pains. In other words, most (but not all) of my life has been without a need to take ongoing pain medication. With all my multiple and frequently severe incidents of pain, after some period of great the pain, the pain has receded.

Currently I am walking my way out of a broken hip. The pain was considerable at first, but what really hrt was the despair.  Now the pain is currently much diminished - yet the anxiety that I will never regain the "walkability" I have lost remains.

In all of these recoveries, the trickier aspect is the mental attitude - particularly dealing with despair, anxiety and depression. The pain may recede, but your depression may not. In fact, intermittent pain may give your brain more time to dwell upon your sorry state.

On the other hand, I think I've also been pretty good at learning how to overcome the mental issues - by the actions I have taken. And this is what what to share.

Did you see this article? I very much agree with the findings of this article:

Effectiveness of physical activity interventions for improving depression, anxiety and distress: an overview of systematic reviews / https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/03/02/bjsports-2022-106195

	What are the new findings
	* Results showed that physical activity is effective for reducing mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety and
	psychological distress (median effect size range=−0.42 to –0.60), compared with usual care across all populations.
	* Our findings underscore the important role of physical activity in the management of mild-to-moderate symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychological distress.

Exercise and recovering from difficult situations have been intertwining factors in my life.

I think you know me as a reasonably happy and enthusiastic person. I was not always this way. I think several factors have helped - some intentional, some accidental. I have a firm believer in the idea that fitness and happiness are just intertwined as lack of exercise and depression.

But I think it is more than just: "be fit, and you won't be depressed". There are a couple of interesting twists that go beyond such a simple mantra.

People usually have a daily or weekly exercise regime. You take time off from what you are doing, go somewhere and do your exercise and then go back to whatever it is you were doing. It may be 20 minutes, it may be an hour, but it is the single period in your day when you are exercising. Of course, when you're finished, you feel pretty good and get on with life.

Unfortunately, depression does not follow a similar schedule. Despair does not occur just for 20 minutes or an hour a day. It's just whenever it wants to be. The single burst of composure after a solitary exercise session is of little help even a few hours later. I think this is where I was just very good lucky in finding a solution.

As you probably know, I sit in front of a computer most all day long. Otherwise, it's at a dining room or conference table. As I aged, I began reading more and more articles that indicated that the more you sit, the more it's unhealthy. Sitting for a long periods without moving is unhealthy. Here are some typical articles:

Why Sitting May Be Bad for Your Brain /

About 10 years ago I decided to switch from five or so one-hour exercise (swimming and Pilates) sessions a week to being active multiple times during the course of each and every day. I wrote and now update computer scripts that encourage me to get up from my desk and do stuff one or more times an hour.

Looking at my fitness app on my phone, I can see that for the past few days, I've been exercising 15 to 20 times a day.Most of these are five minute sessions of walking. These are accompanied by several sessions of actual exercises. So it ends up that I do 70 to 80 minutes of walking and a 20 minutes to 30 minutes of dedicated exercises.

An absolutely unintended consequence of splitting up my exercises this way seems to be that it has done much to improve my mental well being. Perhaps each exercise session increases the serotonin in my brain. Perhaps this gentle activity helps to beat back the door that opens the depression. Certainly a post-exercise lift occurs multiple times in my day.

Getting these exercise sessions to work within a regular life can be tricky. There are some important considerations here. My main intention is to write software or do some kind of intellectual work. Whatever I do must be stress free, I must carry out any activity that seriously interrupts my train of thought. Working this out takes a lot of trial and error.

For me, the trick is to be able to simply stand up from my desk, walk 200 yards, then come back and sit at my desk. I don't have to put on a coat or talk to anybody. Nothing to unlock, the doors are left open. Therefore I do not lose my train of thought. I get back to my desk and just keep on working just where I left off.

The walk is like meditating - perhaps it's like monks and nuns walking down the cloisters praying. I also have weights that I can use at my desk. Other activities I have explored include one of those bicycles that sits under your desk. Another aspect is that I try and track as much data as possible - as evidence in a "Don't break the chain" gambit. My phone keeps track of my steps and gets my weight from the scales by Bluetooth. eyc. I'm always on the look out for new ideas and exercises. All this is an ongoing personal investigation.

Exercise can help combat depression, but how and when you exercise can be just as important. Bye for now, got to run, er, walk!



 if not more, so.
