In a recent message, Isabelle inquired about the possibility of using Olvid "Private messaging for everyone"

Here is one of my observations:

Individuals have jumped fom phone SMS to Apple iMessage to WhatsApp to Telegram to Signal - always seeking more secure and private messaging.

And then, presto, they send out a few indiscreet messages on X and the whole world knows about it.

In the long run, It may be easier just be careful what you say and to whom you say it.
