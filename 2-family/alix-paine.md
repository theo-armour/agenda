Hi Alix

So the day had nothing on the calendar. I planned to do lots of things. And, of course, did almost none of them.

I am a fan of David Allen and his book "Getting Things Done". One of his mantras is: get it out of your brain, write it down. So for decades I've kept long to-do lists. I probably spend more time looking at my to-do list than I spend doing things. ;-)

Today was a perfect example. I spent most of the day on rejigging how I handle my to-do lists.

This involves learning new technology, changing things, doing stuff. Which, of course, for me is a ton of fun.

And I think I actually do get things done. More than most, maybe.

I'm enjoying writing these messages. Somehow it's a way of keeping a diary that I wouldn't normally do for me.

I think of you and hope you are settling into your new home.

## 2025-06-20

Hello Alix

OMG, it's 12:05. I have just spent an hour of my life crafting a reply to a message from a severely depressed widow.

Here's the thing. If she (Phyllis) were sending me jolly messages, I probably would not be replying.

Anyway, I don't know if it is easy for you to read stuff or not. But if it is easy enough, then I could tune you into my "As the world turns" soap opera daily messages.

Anyway, today was quite interesting. Among the good events was I had dinner with my friend Aaron. Aaron is betwixt and between all sorts of things. His brother has made a fortune. And they are very close. Here is the short version of the dialog:

My advice to him was to stop being a salaryman and go help his brother build an extended family, a dynasty - perhaps a family office like the Rockefellers.

He has been trying to learn how to live a hardscrabble life by himself. My advice to work with this brother and build something amazing seemed to resonate.

Hi Alix

The reason I'm writing you every day is because of another woman.

She is the wife of a classmate who died a few weeks ago. Through one of Class of '65 mailing lists I set up, she sent a message to the class, and me being the mailing list master, responded.

We have corresponded every day ever since.

I've never met this person. I've never even talked to this person on the phone. I know almost nothing about them. Yet, for some strange reason, it's interesting to write them an email every day.

But as I was doing this, it began to dawn on me that I have no reason to write this person, and I could care less in some ways. And if I could write a message to anybody at any time about some esoteric things like this, it would be Alix.

So here I am writing to two women every night.

And yet the interesting thing is that there are two very different stories.

She appears to be physically capable of doing almost anything she wants to do, but cannot because she is grieving so hard.

And you seem to be less capable of doing almost anything, but would like to.

In other words, I'm writing to two different people with two different motivations.

And I am enjoying both.

One is talking to a real person with imaginary problems.

The other is talking to an imaginary person (you in a sense in relation to me) with real problems.


Therefore: I do not "need" a response from you for any of my messages.

You have let me know that you can read my messages and that they are not just going into the "ether". And that is good enough for me.













## 2025-06-18

Hi Alix

Oh! I am happy you are getting my messages and taking them in. I'm not sure why I'm doing them, but I do feel happy doing them.

Two nice events today:

Lunch with Laura Burgess. She is a Buddhist "personage" at the San Francisco Zen Center and cousin to one of my fellow residents. She writes books about Buddhism for children that are fun. I invited her to speak to my fellow residents, and she was very successful. Also, I organized a tour for our residents to go and visit the Zen Center and she officiated at the tour. Anyway, anytime you have lunch and talk about the meaning of life is a good lunch. Life is a game, BTW.

Then this afternoon, a bunch of us, including admins, our CEO, layers, consultants, attended the San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting. The Supervisors voted on our planning permission for our plan to add 23 apartments to the campus. I had two minutes to speak. Looking back on it, I think my words were a bit lightweight. Not to worry, the supervisors voted on a number of different aspects and our side won.

There was a meeting this evening that I wanted to attend, the demo day for a tech incubator. The premises are just a 10-minute walk from here, and I hope to be an advisor, but we got home too late from the meeting for me to be able to do that.

Wednesday: Nothing on the calendar. I can do whatever I want. Yippee!

Hi Alix

>>  2 weeks now at Templeton. Relaxing ~ but need to make friends

People who babble make friends faster than people who are silent!

Even when you can't find the word you are looking for. ;-)

Today, fingers crossed, I finally stopped obsessing about writing software and started back on a more normal life. I had two outdoor walks and was more careful about what I ate. I got through a lot of emails, phoned Tania and got a lot of stuff done.

The trick was that coming upstairs after breakfast was not just about starting automatically to keep on with the things I was doing last night, but to stop, think, prepare and reflect upon what I should be doing today, not just jumping in.

***

We are in the process of adding some new units to the property and we are seeking planning permission and other matters that need clearing up through the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Tomorrow I will be appearing before the Board of Supervisors and giving a two or three minute talk. Today I presented my draft to the CEO and the board of directors and they liked what I wrote. ;-)



## 2025-06-15


My day was a bit unusual. I text chatted with my daughters. Here is what I said: Being a father is one of the best things I've ever done. Perhaps the best thing.

My friend Vish Ratnaswamy joined me for the Father's Day celebration in the dining room. He is a Caltech graduate in his 30s. Smart but conflicted. Among other things, for several years he has been teaching foster kids math and science. He applied for a grant from Caltech and just received $65,000 to fulfill his dream of doing something more long-term and constructive with the kids he is helping. We talked about how to maximize the benefits. How to create long-term solutions that go beyond this sum of money. After lunch, I had to go to the bank, and then after, we stopped at my favorite French cheese store and had three cheeses and a glass of wine.

Then I came home and had a nap.

Cheers,

Theo

Hi Alix

Today I went to the 90th birthday party of a friend who has severe memory loss. He is and always was extremely curious, asking lots of questions. Of course, he cannot now remember any of the answers. So he lives in a perpetual "Groundhog Day".

Anyway, I live in a world of old people. I think, for the most part, for most people, life kind of sucks. They are trapped in these old bodies with all sorts of terrible conditions. For the most part, they do their best to ignore all the issues. They watch TV, they read books, they play solitaire on the computer. Anything not to have to think.

The interesting thing is I get to watch all of this.

Geraldine died yesterday, so this means that her son Paul won't be coming around, and I won't be able to talk to him about how his day trading went at the opening bell.

And much much more

In essence, I live in an observation post. I can observe aging firsthand. And it ain't cute. I can't count anybody over the age of 88 here that has any sort of agency or usefulness. It's not that I don't like them. Heck, Margaret Johnson, one of my best friends, is 101.

So I'm just thinking in my brain that my highest ideal age would be 88. I wonder: could I make that happen?

## 2025-06-13

Hi Alix

So today I had lunch with a political group that meets every week.

Today our speaker was my local District 2 Supervisor, Stephen Sherrill.

Well, it turns out that his wife's brother dated Leah Englehart. And his children are in the same preschool as Bennett's and Rob's children.

Other connections occurred as well, but I've never had such a close connection with an elected political official.

I will be seeing Stephen again next week. I've been asked to speak at the Board of Supervisors next meeting, where we will ask to go ahead with our new strategic plan to rebuild the campus.

I don't think I've ever before been as connected to my local political landscape as I am here and now.

Hi Alix


And the past is what it is, immutable apart from our acceptance and understanding of it.

My daughter Cynthia returned from France last night. She took part in her aunt's 80th birthday and is staying a couple of nights, cat-sitting in Mia's place in Oakland.

She came over for dinner tonight and we met at Green's restaurant in Fort Mason, a classic vegetarian restaurant. We had a lovely meal and even better conversation.

One issue of discussion was particularly interesting. I'm finding that there are new ways of writing software with AI. I'm using the new, but I don't yet know how to explain what I'm doing. It's so strange or wrong or whacky that I can't find the words to explain this strange abstraction that is occurring. It's like using buildings to create blueprints. Or poems to create math equations.  

Anyway, I'm obsessed over all this stuff. And I think it's kind of wonderful that I can be 78 and obsessed about anything.

## 2025-06-10

So what am I going to write about tonight? I have already written to Phyllis. She is the lady who was married to one of my St. Paul's classmates. Peer Wedvick who died a few weeks ago. I've never met her, but they lived in Palo Alto. I got involved, so I've been sending her messages every evening for the past few weeks. She's grieving hard, and it's nobody else, and is like so many old people worried about money. Yes, she would like a handout from me. No, I will never give her one.

So I've never met this person. Never even talked to her over the phone. But what I'm liking is that I get to write about something that's on my brain.

And, particularly, that made me think about doing the same communication thing with you, writing about something that's on my brain.

And of course, I've just discovered the thing I'm going to write about is alcohol. No, I'm not. That's too complicated.

I can just say "goodnight" and that's enough?

Actually, the real thing is that I'm involved with the whole complicated AI thing, and it's blasting my brain, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

One of the things I find fascinating is that I can look back on my day and find multiple points in the day that, if I think about it, I could write for pages and pages about it.

This is in total contrast to the first (30?) years of my life, which seemed to me to be totally boring. And, of course, I was bored - and being boring being bored in a bored life.

And things did happen today. I got a website out that I've been working on. I did some pretty amazing stuff using artificial intelligence and running some new software.

But the fun thing to talk about is something that just doesn't happen.

One of my residents down the hall is 101. Her name is Enid. Her son came along with his wife. They are conspiracy theorists and woo-woo and crystals and all that good, wonderful Marin County stuff. He was involved with Est and all the Werner Erhard stuff, and much more.

The fun thing was that Donna, the wife, is one of the most stunning, beautiful mid-70s women I've ever been in the presence of. Think of a surfer chick grown into an elder classic beauty. Old people's hair that still has tinges of blonde. Wrinkles that smile. A smile that radiates happiness.

It reminds me of what some old Chinese gentleman told me back in Hong Kong a long time ago. When a beautiful woman walks into the room, the room goes calm.



## 2025-06-08

Alex Paine came over for lunch today.

He has made a significant recovery from where he was a year ago. I guess some good evidence is that his company, Websight Design, is profitable again. It's not a great metric, but just an indication that he can again cope with at least some of the normal stresses of life.

Also, he and Marissa have established some kind of truce and are doing what they should do: trying to be parents.

In the middle of lunch, My Alix phoned from France. It was Isabelle's sister Sophie's 80th birthday Party. Alix went around the table - and I remembered and shouted out everybody's name! There must be a few brain cells left in here. ;-)

So all in all a lunch that pointed back into so many past circumstances. In many ways I am glad that I'm not "back there". My life today is as interesting as it has ever been. I feel that my values, my ethics, my sensibilities are ever deepening. And very different from those in the past.

And I am thinking of you. You are facing imminent changes. Sometimes clarity. Sometimes I know not what but some kind of non-clarity that I cannot comprehend,

Anyway. It's time for me to go and do that thing which is also not really comprehensible - enter the mind-state of a night's sleep. ;-)


## 2025-06-07

Some days are better. Some days are worse.

Today, I had a better and worse day, and I'm not sure which it was.

There's a part of the software I'm working on that is quite complex. I just tonight realized that there is a much simpler way of handling things. The realization happened after working on the complicated way for weeks. And a part of this code has been lurking in my software, perhaps, for years.

Now, should I be angry with myself for having spent so many months and hours doing the wrong thing? Or should I be totally pleased with myself for finding the right thing?

Well, I won't try the new easy way until tomorrow. Maybe it it will have complications too. Anyway, the questions remains: how did I allow my brain to play such a trick on me?


## 2025-06-06


What would you call it when people spend decades of their lives working on something? For most people, this is probably most evident in the way they evolve and configure their domiciles.

Cynie could turn any place - From Ankara to Miami - into a home we all knew the moment we walked in.

But I'm also thinking of people that write or paint or do some ongoing creative activity from time to time over a long period of time.

Anyway, I have bits of software that I've been working on for many years. Well, one piece that I know goes back to at least 2011 is what I've been working on recently. The nature and scope of the project is immaterial.

The project will never be finished. And that is one of my things: Set goals that will last longer than my life, so that I don't have any my goals finished and I have to get depressed. And at the end of life, you get depressed if you didn't finish the goal, or if you finished the goal and had nothing more to do.

Anyway, one of my software projects that I've been working on, I've recently been obsessing over for the past couple of weeks. It's actually behaving and turning into the thing I think it should be. This involves software that I use every day. And so any improvements or changes in that can disrupt my whole life.

So here I am with "Visions of sugar plums". The project I'm working on is just advancing head over heels into exactly the way I wanted to advance.

Are my intuitions deceiving me? And/or: even if it all works as advertised, will I be any happier?

***

<a few minutes later>

I don't think it makes any difference to Consider if I'll be happier or not. Of course, I will be happy sometimes and unhappy at others.

The skill to develop is an ability to find joy and delight, at least a smidgen, in almost any place or any circumstance.


## 2025-06-05

So today I did a lot of programming. Though I did do some admin in the morning.

The nice thing was that I overdrew my bank account. I haven't done this for years, and it wasn't much. So the easiest thing to do was to go to the bank, take some money out from a credit card and pay it into the checking account.

Well, one of my quite elderly fellow residents here has had a stroke and now he gets around by an electric wheelchair. I invited him to come along with me on the walk down to the bank. To my surprise, he agreed. and he had a lovely time getting out of the house.

## 2025-06-04

When I go out for a walk, I bring my headphones so I can make a call. I often say, well, I will call Tania on my way out and then I will call Alix on my way back.

And then because I'm enjoying the walk, I do neither.

I'm going to try another gambit, which is I'm tending to write thoughtful emails while I'm winding down and getting ready to go to bed.

I started doing this because One of my St. Paul's classmates died a few weeks ago, and I've been in touch with his wife. I've never met, but I've ended up emailing once or twice a day ever since.

She's completely broken up and disconsolate and unhappy and lonely. The main word there is "completely".

She cannot seem to get outside of herself and observe herself in the state she is in. She can say "this sucks", but I don't think she can say "the life I'm in sucks".

And it's being a good learning experience for me. and I've been trying to practice the idea that there shall be no "mansplaining". There shall be no advice giving, unless asked for (And it hasn't). There shall be no deep or extensive questioning.

Just exchanging thoughts and feelings and observations day by day.







## 2025-02-21

After the breakfast the morning after Bennet's wedding, I told Alix that I loved her.

Her reply was simply perfect. She said "I know."

All my life there has been a person I loved

And always will be.

So it goes.


## 2025-02-??  My love

I have loved Alix Paine probably ever since we met.

* While Alix never encouraged me to love her,
* she never discouraged me either.
* She was always kind and considerate.
* She was always a good friend.


## 2025-02-08

Hi Alix

I am so happy that you are coming to San Francisco.

I often think of coming to Durham to visit you. I am not able to do so because of too many toilet and fall risk issues.

I really appreciate your coming to San Francisco.

love,

Theo

PS And thank you for the kind words about the Heritage Happenings.
