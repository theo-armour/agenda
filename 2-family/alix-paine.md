What would you call it when people spend decades of their lives working on something? For most people, this is probably most evident in the way they evolve and configure their domiciles.

Cynie could turn any place - From Ankara to Miami - into a home we all knew the moment we walked in.

But I'm also thinking of people that write or paint or do some ongoing creative activity from time to time over a long period of time.

Anyway, I have bits of software that I've been working on for many years. Well, one piece that I know goes back to at least 2011 is what I've been working on recently. The nature and scope of the project is immaterial. 

The project will never be finished. And that is one of my things: Set goals that will last longer than my life, so that I don't have any my goals finished and I have to get depressed. And at the end of life, you get depressed if you didn't finish the goal, or if you finished the goal and had nothing more to do. 

Anyway, one of my software projects that I've been working on, I've recently been obsessing over for the past couple of weeks. It's actually behaving and turning into the thing I think it should be. This involves software that I use every day. And so any improvements or changes in that can disrupt my whole life. 

So here I am with "Visions of sugar plums". The project I'm working on is just advancing head over heels into exactly the way I wanted to advance. 

Are my intuitions deceiving me? And/or: even if it all works as advertised, will I be any happier?

I don't think it makes any difference to Consider if I'll be happier or not. Of course, I will be happy sometimes and unhappy at others. 

The skill to develop is an ability to find joy and delight, at least a smidgen, in almost any place or any circumstance.

So today I did a lot of programming. Though I did do some admin in the morning.

The nice thing was that I overdrew my bank account. I haven't done this for years, and it wasn't much. So the easiest thing to do was to go to the bank, take some money out from a credit card and pay it into the checking account.

Well, one of my quite elderly fellow residents here has had a stroke and now he gets around by an electric wheelchair. I invited him to come along with me on the walk down to the bank. To my surprise, he agreed. and he had a lovely time getting out of the house.

When I go out for a walk, I bring my headphones so I can make a call. I often say, well, I will call Tania on my way out and then I will call Alix on my way back. 

And then because I'm enjoying the walk, I do neither. 

I'm going to try another gambit, which is I'm tending to write thoughtful emails while I'm winding down and getting ready to go to bed. 

I started doing this because One of my St. Paul's classmates died a few weeks ago, and I've been in touch with his wife. I've never met, but I've ended up emailing once or twice a day ever since. 

She's completely broken up and disconsolate and unhappy and lonely. The main word there is "completely".  

She cannot seem to get outside of herself and observe herself in the state she is in. She can say "this sucks", but I don't think she can say "the life I'm in sucks". 

And it's being a good learning experience for me. and I've been trying to practice the idea that there shall be no "mansplaining". There shall be no advice giving, unless asked for (And it hasn't). There shall be no deep or extensive questioning. 

Just exchanging thoughts and feelings and observations day by day.

After the breakfast the morning after Bennet's wedding, I told Alix that I loved her.

Her reply was simply perfect. She said "I know."

All my life there has been a person I loved

And always will be.

So it goes.


## 2025-02-??  My love

I have loved Alix Paine probably ever since we met.

* While Alix never encouraged me to love her, 
* she never discouraged me either. 
* She was always kind and considerate. 
* She was always a good friend.

Hi Alix

I am so happy that you are coming to San Francisco.

I often think of coming to Durham to visit you. I am not able to do so because of too many toilet and fall risk issues.

I really appreciate your coming to San Francisco.

love,

Theo

PS And thank you for the kind words about the Heritage Happenings.
