So what am I going to write about tonight? I have already written to Phyllis. She is the lady who was married to one of my St. Paul's classmates. Peer Wedvick who died a few weeks ago. I've never met her, but they lived in Palo Alto. I got involved, so I've been sending her messages every evening for the past few weeks. She's grieving hard, and it's nobody else, and is like so many old people worried about money. Yes, she would like a handout from me. No, I will never give her one. 

So I've never met this person. Never even talked to her over the phone. But what I'm liking is that I get to write about something that's on my brain. 

And, particularly, that made me think about doing the same communication thing with you, writing about something that's on my brain. 

And of course, I've just discovered the thing I'm going to write about is alcohol. No, I'm not. That's too complicated. 

I can just say "goodnight" and that's enough?

Actually, the real thing is that I'm involved with the whole complicated AI thing, and it's blasting my brain, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

One of the things I find fascinating is that I can look back on my day and find multiple points in the day that, if I think about it, I could write for pages and pages about it. 

This is in total contrast to the first (30?) years of my life, which seemed to me to be totally boring. And, of course, I was bored - and being boring being bored in a bored life. 

And things did happen today. I got a website out that I've been working on. I did some pretty amazing stuff using artificial intelligence and running some new software. 

But the fun thing to talk about is something that just doesn't happen. 

One of my residents down the hall is 101. Her name is Enid. Her son came along with his wife. They are conspiracy theorists and woo-woo and crystals and all that good, wonderful Marin County stuff. He was involved with Est and all the Werner Erhard stuff, and much more. 

The fun thing was that Donna, the wife, is one of the most stunning, beautiful mid-70s women I've ever been in the presence of. Think of a surfer chick grown into an elder classic beauty. Old people's hair that still has tinges of blonde. Wrinkles that smile. A smile that radiates happiness. 

It reminds me of what some old Chinese gentleman told me back in Hong Kong a long time ago. When a beautiful woman walks into the room, the room goes calm.

Alex Paine came over for lunch today. 

He has made a significant recovery from where he was a year ago. I guess some good evidence is that his company, Websight Design, is profitable again. It's not a great metric, but just an indication that he can again cope with at least some of the normal stresses of life. 

Also, he and Marissa have established some kind of truce and are doing what they should do: trying to be parents.

In the middle of lunch, My Alix phoned from France. It was Isabelle's sister Sophie's 80th birthday Party. Alix went around the table - and I remembered and shouted out everybody's name! There must be a few brain cells left in here. ;-)

So all in all a lunch that pointed back into so many past circumstances. In many ways I am glad that I'm not "back there". My life today is as interesting as it has ever been. I feel that my values, my ethics, my sensibilities are ever deepening. And very differentÂ from those in the past.

And I am thinking of you. You are facing imminent changes. Sometimes clarity. Sometimes I know not what but some kind of non-clarity that I cannot comprehend,

Anyway. It's time for me to go and do that thing which is also not really comprehensible - enter the mind-state of a night's sleep. ;-)

Some days are better. Some days are worse.

Today, I had a better and worse day, and I'm not sure which it was. 

There's a part of the software I'm working on that is quite complex. I just tonight realized that there is a much simpler way of handling things. The realization happened after working on the complicated way for weeks. And a part of this code has been lurking in my software, perhaps, for years. 

Now, should I be angry with myself for having spent so many months and hours doing the wrong thing? Or should I be totally pleased with myself for finding the right thing? 

Well, I won't try the new easy way until tomorrow. Maybe it it will have complications too. Anyway, the questions remains: how did I allow my brain to play such a trick on me?

What would you call it when people spend decades of their lives working on something? For most people, this is probably most evident in the way they evolve and configure their domiciles.

Cynie could turn any place - From Ankara to Miami - into a home we all knew the moment we walked in.

But I'm also thinking of people that write or paint or do some ongoing creative activity from time to time over a long period of time.

Anyway, I have bits of software that I've been working on for many years. Well, one piece that I know goes back to at least 2011 is what I've been working on recently. The nature and scope of the project is immaterial. 

The project will never be finished. And that is one of my things: Set goals that will last longer than my life, so that I don't have any my goals finished and I have to get depressed. And at the end of life, you get depressed if you didn't finish the goal, or if you finished the goal and had nothing more to do. 

Anyway, one of my software projects that I've been working on, I've recently been obsessing over for the past couple of weeks. It's actually behaving and turning into the thing I think it should be. This involves software that I use every day. And so any improvements or changes in that can disrupt my whole life. 

So here I am with "Visions of sugar plums". The project I'm working on is just advancing head over heels into exactly the way I wanted to advance. 

Are my intuitions deceiving me? And/or: even if it all works as advertised, will I be any happier?

***

<a few minutes later>

I don't think it makes any difference to Consider if I'll be happier or not. Of course, I will be happy sometimes and unhappy at others. 

The skill to develop is an ability to find joy and delight, at least a smidgen, in almost any place or any circumstance.

So today I did a lot of programming. Though I did do some admin in the morning.

The nice thing was that I overdrew my bank account. I haven't done this for years, and it wasn't much. So the easiest thing to do was to go to the bank, take some money out from a credit card and pay it into the checking account.

Well, one of my quite elderly fellow residents here has had a stroke and now he gets around by an electric wheelchair. I invited him to come along with me on the walk down to the bank. To my surprise, he agreed. and he had a lovely time getting out of the house.

When I go out for a walk, I bring my headphones so I can make a call. I often say, well, I will call Tania on my way out and then I will call Alix on my way back. 

And then because I'm enjoying the walk, I do neither. 

I'm going to try another gambit, which is I'm tending to write thoughtful emails while I'm winding down and getting ready to go to bed. 

I started doing this because One of my St. Paul's classmates died a few weeks ago, and I've been in touch with his wife. I've never met, but I've ended up emailing once or twice a day ever since. 

She's completely broken up and disconsolate and unhappy and lonely. The main word there is "completely".  

She cannot seem to get outside of herself and observe herself in the state she is in. She can say "this sucks", but I don't think she can say "the life I'm in sucks". 

And it's being a good learning experience for me. and I've been trying to practice the idea that there shall be no "mansplaining". There shall be no advice giving, unless asked for (And it hasn't). There shall be no deep or extensive questioning. 

Just exchanging thoughts and feelings and observations day by day.

After the breakfast the morning after Bennet's wedding, I told Alix that I loved her.

Her reply was simply perfect. She said "I know."

All my life there has been a person I loved

And always will be.

So it goes.


## 2025-02-??  My love

I have loved Alix Paine probably ever since we met.

* While Alix never encouraged me to love her, 
* she never discouraged me either. 
* She was always kind and considerate. 
* She was always a good friend.

Hi Alix

I am so happy that you are coming to San Francisco.

I often think of coming to Durham to visit you. I am not able to do so because of too many toilet and fall risk issues.

I really appreciate your coming to San Francisco.

love,

Theo

PS And thank you for the kind words about the Heritage Happenings.
