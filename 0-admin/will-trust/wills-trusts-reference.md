# Wills and Trusts

* Trusts are useful when minors are involved and or you want to control exactly how money is to be distributed or you want to avoid probate
* Then: Isabelle and I had a living trust when ACE were minors
* Now: I do not want to control in any way the money I leave to ACE except in the case of avoiding taxes or simplifying the transfer of money
* "Avoiding probate" by setting up a trust to accompany a will is frequently mentioned as a good thing to do
* The kind of trust I want to set set up would be of of very short duration - and allow speediest transfer of funds to ACE


## Definitions

* ACE: Alix, Cynthia and Eloise
* Probate: the judicial process whereby a will is "proved" in a court of law and accepted as a valid public document that is the true last testament of the deceased, or whereby the estate is settled according to the laws of intestacy in the state of residence of the deceased at time of death in the absence of a legal will.

* Tax Basis: A tax basis is the value of an asset that is used when determining the gain or loss when the asset is sold. Generally, it equals the asset purchase price minus any accumulated depreciation
* Trust: a three-party fiduciary relationship in which the first party, the trustor or settlor, transfers ("settles") a property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the trustee) for the benefit of the third party, the beneficiary

* Trustor: person creating the trust
* Beneficiary: person receiving funds from the trust
* Trustee: Person employed to manage the trust


## General wishes

* All my money goes to ACE with as few encumbrances as possible
* Collectively we decide if some money should go to Isabelle or charities such as schools
* IMO, the sooner the money gets to ACE the better. For example. I could see giving them all my money while I am alive - and they pay me an allowance to live on.


## Funeral arrangements

* Body to UCSF or cremation
* If cremation, ashes go where?
* No church service but may party somewhere

## Legal processes

* The trust Isabelle and I set up cost $6,000 in the 1990s and required many hours of prep
* There are online services that will help you set up a trust for $150
* I don't know when and how you decide one trust-preparing solution is better than the other
* I do know that talking to lawyers can cost hundreds of dollars per hour
* Before committing to a lawyer I want to know enough to feel confident it's the best way to go
* I plan to use the low-cost online services as my learning tool for the topic.


## Transfer of money

* Promises to ACE
  * $15K per year
  * minimum of $20K for weddings
  * $100K to help with property purchase
* Best processes for avoiding gift taxes
  * Investigating Generation Skipping Transfers (GST)
  * IRS: need to file IRS Form 709 for gifts over $15K
  * CA: just started thinking about this
  * Taxes to be paid by me to IRS and CA : should br zero
  * Taxes to be paid by ACE in US to IRS and: should be zero
  * Taxes to be paid by ACE in other countries
* To be explored: The interplay between the gift tax and the estate tax ~ Tax Basis

> The tax basis issue
> As you consider making gifts, keep in mind that very different rules determine the tax basis of property someone receives by gift versus receives by inheritance. For example, if your son inherits your property, his tax basis would be the fair market value of the property on the date you die. That means all appreciation during your lifetime becomes tax-free.
>
>However, if he receives the property as a gift from you, generally his tax basis is whatever your tax basis was. That means he'll likely owe tax on appreciation during your life, just like you would have if you sold the asset yourself. The rule that "steps up" basis to date of death value for inherited assets can save heirs billions of dollars every year.
* Best process for transferring assets from me to ACE
  * Must consider the benefit of the tax basis on date of death
  * thinking out loud: if we get a really godd valuation on giving the paintings away then we should set that off me selling sticks and giving ACE the cash
