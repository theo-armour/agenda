Hi Mia and Cynthia

>let’s look into hiring a helper.

Doh! Thank you for thinking this up. It's a great idea. It would be a really good thing for me to be able to organize and host gigs here. Our dining service is wonderful, but unfortunately scheduling takes at least a month of advance notice. Having a nimbler alternative would be great.
But given my and your schedules this week, it's best to make this a clever idea to pursue in the new year.
Cynthia: me begging you to rush down is also not something I want to pursue.
So, I will let the Englehardt's, Smiths, CynthiaM and Peter know that that there will be no gala celebration, but any and all are invited for a meal at my house or anywhere nearby at anytime.
