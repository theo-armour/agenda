NIA ~ wellness dimensions

The National Wellness Institute (NWI) promotes six dimensions of wellness:
emotional, occupational, physical, social, intellectual, and spiritual. [1]
*Image: six dimensions of wellness [1]
The NWI believes that addressing all six dimensions of wellness can lead to a holistic sense of wellness and fulfillment. [1]
Other models of wellness dimensions include: [2]

Eight dimensions of wellness

This model includes physical, environmental, financial, psychological/emotional, social, spiritual, occupational, and intellectual dimensions. [2]

Seven dimensions of wellness

This model includes physical, intellectual, environmental, vocational, social, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. [3]

12 dimensions of wellness

This model includes self-responsibility, breathing, sensing, eating, moving, feeling, thinking, playing, working, communicating, intimacy, finding meaning, and transcending. [4]


The dimensions of wellness are interdependent and overlap, meaning that neglecting one dimension can negatively affect your overall health and well-being. [5, 6, 7]

Generative AI is experimental.
