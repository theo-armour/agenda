Current Chaos & Disruption
If you read what "we" read it's full of bad news

But if you read the conservative press it's mostly good news

The disruptions are targeted at college educated and people who own shares.

The disruptions are not targeted at the working class. Yet.

Framework: Goals ~ Spending ~ Investments
I don't anticipate any significant changes in the next year, but can reduce spending as and when the market tanks.

So: "Anyone can steer the ship, but a leader must chart the course." Keep at it!
