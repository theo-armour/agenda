Hi Carmen

I hoper you are enjoying the balmy fall weather.

Thank you for uploading the vouchers to the Block Portal.

IRS Vouchers
I note that the IRS vouchers show my address as 3400 Laguna Street but there is no indication of the apartment number: #227C. Can you kindly add my apartment number to the vouchers and re-upload them?

FTB Vouchers
below is a screenshot of the FTB voucher

I do not feel comfortable sending an unapproved form to my bank. Is there any way to create a voucher that does not have this text? Please advise.

Payment confirmation
If I remember correctly, We used the refund to pay the 2023 estimated payments through September and that I should pay the January 2023 payment from my Pershing account. Please confirm.

Future Meeting
I am planning to set up a Donar Advised Fund with my children. I would like to discuss this with you. I am just beginning to get going on this. I will send you a meeting request for a 30 minute meeting in the next few weeks.

Thank you

Theo
