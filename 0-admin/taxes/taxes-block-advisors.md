Hi Carmen,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am trying to deal with my 2023 estimated payments. I am looking at "2022 Individual Tax Return" in the H&RBlock.com "myb-documents" folder.

On page 58 I see see amounts due to the US Treasury butI see no vouchers with addresses etc.

On Page 63 I see an address for the FTB but again no vouchers with amounts.

Hi Carmen,

Thank you for the meeting on Saturday. I am looking forward to working with you.

I have uploaded a number of documents relating to the 2021 tax year to MyBlock/Documents/2021.

The files seem to be duplicated, but if I erase one then both files seem to disappear.

I will be uploading the documents for 2022 as I prepare and/or scan them.

Theo
