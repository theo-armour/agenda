## Who We Are

>San Francisco Village is a membership organization designed with, by and for older San Franciscans and the extended community that champions them.

>We operationalize love for elders in an ageist society by mobilizing the power of intergenerational relationships and mutual support.

>We envision a future in which people of all ages, races, cultures, and abilities work together to create communities of belonging and in so doing, model possibilities for relationship and connection that benefit the greater good.
