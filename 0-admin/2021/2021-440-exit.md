# 440 Exit

Hi Gateway Management

After nearly twenty years of very happy living at the Gateway,  it became a good thing for me to move to a long term care facility. The last of my possession should be out by March 26th. I am paid up through April 1.

Kindly advise me what I need to do to bring my lease to an end in a speedy and agreeable manner.

Thank you!

Theo
