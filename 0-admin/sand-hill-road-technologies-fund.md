Robert, after careful consideration, I have decided that I cannot move forward with the agreement. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Theo

Hello Eloise, Cynthia, and Alix

Via my friend Jim Michler, I have been offered pre-ipo shares in OpenAI. Jim has already acquired shares.

As you know, I have been an OpenAI user since its inception. I would consider this as a long term investment - and not just a speculation. And as a shareholder I would be able to participate in a small way in the governance of the company. The cost of the shares is $100,100. Any shares I acquire would be added to the trust held by Pershing and managed by Josh.

Before I make a decision, I would like to know if you have any thoughts on this offer.

I must make a decision by mid-week.

Love,

Daddy

Please advise me on how you arrive at the value of the "unit". Can you share the formula you use to calculate the value of the unit in a way that I can share with my financial advisor?

Hi Larry

I hope you and your good family are all well. All is well on my side of the street.

Can you advise me on the following - which I believe is inline with your expertise.

I have been offered pre-ipo shares in OpenAI by Sand Hill Road Technologies Fund. I have invested in a lot of startups but never in this way and I am financially qualified to do so.

Could you kindly suggest someone I might talk to about this kind of offer and suggest the the questions I should be asking?
