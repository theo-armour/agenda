"Buy gold"

Issues

* market timing
* When to sell?
* reputable and safe custodians and brokers
* SEC for gold?

Want

* Strategies that everybody can use with disrupting
* Strategies that can help my daughters the funds I have given them

I am

* Investor helping provide capital
* Money market participant - helping provide liquidity
* Client providing fees to a wealth manager

Economics

* No disruptions
* No timing
* All long term strategies

Vision

* Sustainable
* Productive
* Helpful

Fellowship

* Single investor "tips" suck
* If these companies sink, the the US sinks, and I sink with it
* Given the funds I have, I will always be closer to the top of the heap

The point of being rich

* not having to worry as much
* not to have to make decisions about money
* to use the privileges to good use
