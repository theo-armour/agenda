## Copy of 2001 Separation Agreement

We want to obtain a copy of the 2001 Separation Agreement agreement to see if it contained anything of interest pertaining to my wills and trusts.

We asked our mediator/lawyer David Sutton to send us a copy of the 2001 separation agreement.  We have not received it. His paralegal (Ashley?) was assigned the task of getting obtaining a copy from the court where it was filed.  We have not heard from her.

I may have a copy of the 2001 separation agreement. I will look for it. Fingers crossed: I have a digital copy. Otherwise it's a visit to the dreaded storage unit.

Once a version of the 2001 separation agreement is obtained, we need to submit it to Vivian for review.

Action: Theo to look for a copy of the 2001 separation agreement.

## Letter from Isabelle

Given the slow process of getting in touch with David Sutton, I believe we asked for Vivian to draft a letter for Isabelle to sign that would verify that she has no interest in my wills and trusts.

Did Vivian ever draft such a letter? I can't seem to find it.

In her letter of January 24, Vivian said would work with David Sutton. She was going to ask him to draft a letter for Isabelle to sign. This scares me. David is happy to talk for hours - and I'm sure Vivian at $1K her hour would be delighted to listen for hours.

I have asked ChatGPT to draft the letter for me. I asked it to draft a letter for Isabelle to sign that would verify that she has no interest in my wills and trusts.

## Donor Advised Fund (DAF)

We have only discussed the DAF with Vivian. We have not discussed it with Josh Huffard or Lea. I think it would be good to get going with Josh in the near future on getting us all up to speed on what it all involves and what the pros and cons are.
