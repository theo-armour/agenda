# 2023-12-08 Girls Tax Refund

Hi Alix, Cynthia and Eloise

Josh and Danielle : I am copying you both on this email - just for your information only. No response is required.

Earlier this year I cheerily promised the three of you that I would share $15K with each of you from the proceeds of my tax refunds. Having finally had my taxes for 2022 calculated, it looked like the sale of stock was much less that 2021 and I was due a tasty refund.

Sure enough, the state of California sent me $23K and out of that I sent each of you $5K. IRS was a different case, however. At the end of October the IRS sent me a letter saying my refund was $0. See 2023-10-30-irs-cp34.pdf

I looked into my instructions to DWA. See this email thread. All looked OK.

I checked the Pershing transactions. See 2023-12-08-pershing-irs.pdf. As far as I can see all the California estimated payments were made correctly. Regarding the IRS, I can see an single estimated payment of $16,332 in April. Soon after, the IRS refunded me the same amount because of some confusion somewhere, but the June payment did go through. The two other payments of $16,332 do not seem to have been made.

Well, given the losses of 2022, I frankly quite happy that the IRS estimated payments were *not* made.

Anyway the upshot is that I am not getting a refund from the IRS. So it's not as if I have lots of extra money to share with you. ;-(

Nonetheless that market has recovered quite nicely. I feel I can now start sharing the benefits with you again. More on that after we have discussed my finance over the holidays.

Love,

Daddy
