Hi Josh

I finally have completed my 2022 taxes.

I'm once again using a real human - at HR Block Advisors. This will help in the event of dementia or whatever.

My 2023 past due estimated payments were made using the refund from 2022. I will, however pay the January payments with funds from my Pershing account.

My question is this. I would like to send DWA the vouchers - which have my social security number on them. Does DWA have simple simple but secure way to do transfer files? Or should I zip and password protect them and send them to you via email?

PS Or am I being old school? Should I just send them via Gmail ~ figuring that messages are now end-to-end encrypted?
