Hi Josh

Last August I wrote to you about my daughters and my investment in Kayakomat. There have been a number of updates since then. Please see attached file.

At the current valuation, our 3.4% may be worth over US $800K. A new investor is coming on board and if the deal goes through the valuation will be double that.

In order to maintain our percentage with the restructuring about to be finalized we ned to invest an additional 200,000 SEK (or about $18,500).

My daughters and I are pleased with the progress of the company and would like to maintain our percentage. We are prepared to invest the additional funds.

If you can get Pershing to send the funds to Sweden, that would be great and I can send the routing info. If not, please let me know and arrange for the transfer of 18K to my Chase account.

Theo
