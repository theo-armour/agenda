Hi Danielle,

I hope you are enjoying your summer..

Last April, I requested that DWA arrange for the quarterly transfer of funds from my Pershing Account to my Chase account in order to cover tax payments.

My plan has changed. In the future I will use the funds transferred from trusts managed by Eastern Bank.

Therefore, please cancel any future transfer of funds from my Pershing account to my Chase account.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Theo
