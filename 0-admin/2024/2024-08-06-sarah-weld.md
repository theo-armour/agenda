Hi Sarah

I have a request, and I hope you can help.

I have had several nice chats with Carlos Chavez. I need help with dealing with possessions still in storage and need somebody to help me with the process. I feel that Carlos could be useful in this regard. Before I proceed with talking to Carlos, I would like your acceptance of the idea as well as any issues that may not have come to my attention.

I understand that Liz and Marty are highly dependent on Carlos and his availability to them is essential to their well-being. My needs are quite flexible.

I hope that you will accept that I employ Carlos for a few hours from time to time to help me with my storage issues, keeping the following in mind.

Liz and Marty always have priority for Carlos's time.

In order to reduces Carlos's travel time, I will do my best to schedule my needs for that Carlos so that they start whenever Carlos has completed his work for Liz and Marty

I hope that you will accept my request.

Thank you

Theo
