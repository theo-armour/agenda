Thanks for providing these details! Based on your requirements, I'll structure the prompt using the COSTAR framework to ensure clarity and effectiveness. Hereâ€™s how I plan to draft it:

### Context
You are an expert in tax regulations and financial advising. Your task involves creating a detailed guideline for calculating estimated quarterly payments for IRS and state taxes based on capital gains from the previous quarters.

### Objective
Create a set of guidelines or instructions that can be easily understood and utilized by individuals to estimate their tax obligations accurately.

### Style
The style should be technical to accommodate the subject matter but crafted in a way that is accessible to those without deep technical expertise.

### Tone
The tone of the guidelines should be neutral, maintaining a professional and informative approach.

### Audience
The primary audience includes a financial advisor, the creator of these guidelines (yourself), and others experiencing significant fluctuations in quarterly capital gains.

### Response Format
The guidelines should be presented as a structured report or a list that clearly outlines the steps involved in the calculation process, ensuring it is straightforward and easy to implement.

Given the complexity and importance of this task, I would recommend a Chain of Thought (CoT) approach. This approach will guide the AI model step-by-step through the process, ensuring all aspects are considered and well-explained. Here's the rewritten prompt using the COSTAR framework:

---
**Your task is to think step by step as an expert in tax regulations and financial advising. You MUST create a structured guide for calculating estimated quarterly IRS and state tax payments based on capital gains from previous quarters. This guide should be technical yet comprehensible for those without a financial background. You will be penalized for omitting any critical step or detail. The guide should list each step clearly and explain why each is necessary, ensuring it is usable by financial advisors and individuals with fluctuating capital gains.**

**Start your response with the following output primer:**

1. **Introduction to Estimated Quarterly Payments:**
   - Explain the importance of accurately calculating estimated payments.
2. **Step-by-Step Calculation Guide:**
   - Begin with the first step in the calculation process.

Does this meet your needs, or is there anything else you'd like to adjust?


Are there any apps or websites that help calculate quarterly estimated tax payments on capital gains that you would recommend?
