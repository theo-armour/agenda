2024 Tax Payments Transfers

Hi Olivia

At last and despite a number of hiccoughs, my 2023 tax return is complete and I have the numbers for tax payments due. In order to pay the taxes, my checking account wants funding. Please arrange for the transfer of $40,000 from my Pershing account to my Chase checking account ending in 3203 as soon as possible.

Regarding funding my 2024 estimated taxes, please also schedule funds to be transferred to my Chase account. The due date and the amounts are as follows.

* 2024-06-17: $13,100
* 2024-09-16: $7,500
* 2025-01-15: $11,700

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Cheers,

Theo
