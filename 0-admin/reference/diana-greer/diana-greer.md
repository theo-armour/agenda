### Continuing the effort We started.

Hi Diana

Sorry for the slow reply. I was working on getting the monthly newsletter out last week. And then I have to catch up with all the things I didn't do while I was preparing it.

I just looked for your email but I can't see it. Maybe I deleted it. Please send again. t.armour@gmail.com.

I would very much like to continue what we started. I see three different areas we can work on.:
Physical: Finding new homes for my old things.Tech: Establishing guidelines, methods and best practices for managing online digital archives.Philosophical: Investigating the ways aging white males can overcome their biases and preconceptions and reach new understandings.In all of these: we both explore, learn and add to the ways we can help others.
It would be really helpful to me if we could talk these over in person. My favorite way of doing this is over a meal. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. I am willing to pay $70 and the price of the meal at my house for, say, two hours of your time: one hour of talk and one hour for travel.

How does this sound to you? I am very flexible on time and place.

Cheers,

Theo

Diana,

Time is on your side
You are young and you are smart. Stay curious and keep learning. Keep doing this for several more decades and, Bingo!, you will be older and wiser. And happier.

Of course, there luck and statistics are involved as well.

Privilege comes easily
I was raised in the right address , went to the best schools, ate at the finest restaurants. I was raised to look down my nose at people. By some amazing thing, I happened to be able to learn to view people in other ways. Looking up, over inside and out. Which turns out to be more fun, engaging and beautiful

My bad
No mater how wise, caring and generous I may be, I must accept that I will at times be involved with cruelty, inattention and with things I could have changed.

Theo,
Thank you for your words. Yes.
I appreciate the way you speak.
I am awed that you read as much as you did.
Its a rough thing to read. It is a short book and it took me over a month; I spent a lot of time stomping around my apartment and calling my smart girlfriend to have her explain things to me. It took me a long, long time to "get it."
Warmly,
Diana

Hi Diana

I've read the intro, first chapter, epilogue and glossary of White Women. Some thoughts: Many meaningful, believable, depressing observations. The ignorance, insensitivity and close-mindedness. Of me. Of us.

The difficulty, the impossibility of seeing oneself clearly and finding some way of doing something useful.

I have exhibited all nine practices of white supremacy they discuss. I acknowledge that I will most likely continue to do so in the future.  My hope is that I continue to learn, become aware and update my behaviors so as to diminish being evil.

Theo

## 2024-11-19 Diana's reply

I am excited to tell you how I became radicalized. I read the book White Women by Saira Rao and Regina Jackson. I considered myself a non-racist person, and I was proud if the way I "didn't see color." Ugh. I learned I had more to learn on that. Then, I accidentally learned about the genocide happening in Palestine. I spend 12 noon to 12:30, M-F at JewishVoiceForPeace.org's webinar. The folks there are helping form my political world views. They have lit a fire. And of course as a longtime fan of EFF I care about preserving my rights and freedoms on the internet. Combine these things together and that makes me a person aiming to spend her final years helping buck the systems that enslave many.
Warmly,
Diana
    Aaron Bushnell's final post: Many of us like to ask ourselves, “What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow South? Or apartheid?
What would I do if my country was committing genocide?
The answer is, you're doing it. Right now.”

    Dismantle white supremacy.
Read the book White Women by Saira Rao & Regina Jackson.
Watch their documentary Deconstructing Karen.

* Storage unit: Photo triage and more
* Tech: managing an archive
* Chat: anarchy, bias, a gentle worldview,

Hi Diana

I left it a bit late. I have a ton to say. I will just bullet some of thoughts. We can double-click on any of these when we meet. And, please note, this is late night writing and not to be relied on for anything.

## Fees: a few thoughts

I like to start at a low end of the scale and then move up with bonuses and raises. I am thinking of offering you $35 per hour.

I am very conscious of travel times and costs and will consider compensation for these.

I hope we could work out a plan for, say, ten to fifteen hours a month.

Most everything I do is digital. I hope I can pay using Zelle or PayPal. Payment early in the month for the previous month.

## Storage Unit

You have seen all the stuff. The project at hand is to find nice new homes for everything. It's not about selling or disposing of anything. It's about finding the right place for everything. This is a project that will take a long time. I hope we can work on it together.

## Tech

Your tech experience intrigues me. Once everything is scanned (somehow) how does one manage and maintain these digital? Interesting question, I think.

Everything I do is free and open source. It's not about making money. It's about making both the content and the tools work for people no matter their economic status.

## Chat

You talked of being an anarchist. This is not a usual worldview. It is intentional, studied and pushy. As you have been able to observe, I come from an extremely privileged background. I am very conscious of this and have worked hard at being a father of three daughters who normal and to be unselfish in friendship and more. I am very interested in your worldview and how you came to it and finding points of agreement and disagreement.

## Next steps

We should zoom or meetup.

Hi Diana. Thank you very much for your wonderful efforts last week. I really appreciate your professionalism and your sharps eye. I hope and look forward to another session with you. The objective: finish with finding photos and then starting to collect these into something that can be shipped tp the scanning people.

I also talked to Donna about my employing you for techie work. I specifically said that I initiated the request and that anything we might do would absolutely follow Next Village guidelines.

Donna said this could be possible. It would be organized by Jacqueline who is not back for another week. It would also involves us signing a document that this effort is not part of Next Village.

very effective hour in storage

very much into anarchy

Must talk to her about "The Gaze"

Tuesday 10:30

2024-11-09 txt: Diana: I really look forward to meeting you and getting things done. But, please can we reschedule? Either 11:30 or another day?

Allowing for 30 minutes to go, 60 minutes there, and either 30 minutes back (or you leave from the storage). I will be able to reserve the Heritage van, so getting there and back should be easy. Cheers, Theo
