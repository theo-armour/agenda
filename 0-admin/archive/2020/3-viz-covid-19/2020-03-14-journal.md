## Why am I doing this? Part 2

I'm 73. I am finding growing old to be a very interesting topic. It's a great learning experience. Is the ultimate challenge: how well can you die? See also my post [My New Side Hustle: Death 2.0](https://medium.com/@ta/my-new-side-hustle-death-2-0-490449d12e2d).

Elsewhere, I'm working on writing a summary of a book titled ([Successful Aging]( https://www.amazon.com/Successful-Aging-Neuroscientist-Explores-Potential/dp/1524744182 ) by Dan Levitin. Dan proposes that people who live well until their death tend to follow the principles of COACH:

COACH = conscientiousness, openness, affiliations, curiosity, and healthy lifestyle.

Dan asks us to work at being more conscientious. Relevant quotes include:

* “Do things when you say you’ll do them. See your doctor regularly. If the doctor tells you to do something, do it,” he said. “Conscientiousness is associated with much better life outcomes.”
* conscientiousness includes Include organized, responsible, careful, and practical, and the opposites disorganized, irresponsible, sloppy, and impractical. People who score high in this dimension tend to be prepared, be diligent, pay attention to details, and do what they say they will do
* To become more conscientious, one must change underline cognitive processes such a self regulation (Controlling impulsive behaviors) and self monitoring (Noticing which circumstances lead to successful self regulation in which circumstances sabotage self regulation).
* Self-regulation - controlling impulsive behaviors
* Self-monitoring - noticing which circumstances lead to better self regulation and which sabotage sef-regulation
* Too conscientious: Obsessive compulsive disorder


The words that resonate with me are: "If the doctor tells you to do something, do it"

These are not words I like to hear. They sound like:

* Follow the rules
* Do what teacher tells you
* Be good and play nice, work hard, stay kind


I consider myself impulsive and often impractical. I want to:

* Move fast and break things
* Think different
* Stay hungry. Stay foolish
* <Think> it's better to be a pirate than to join the Navy

And as happens from time to time, I stop working on whatever and double-click to something random and unrelated. This time it was COVID-19. And, gues what? Yoo can keep clicking all day long. Lested after the break are links and quotes from a variety of sources. And, guess wha: They are all about doctors telling me what to do. Starting from the top here is what I found

 * Because I'm older I'm more vulnerable
 * Because I'm more vulnerable I should take special precautions
 * The most important precaution is social distancing

So here I am in training to become some kind of [goody-goody]( https://www.thefreedictionary.com/goody-goody ) [teacher's pet]( https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Teacher%27s%20Pet ). At least I'm with somebody who is a lot of fun to be with - which is me!
