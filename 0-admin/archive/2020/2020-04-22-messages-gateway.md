I am thinking about leaving a sticky note by the elevators with the following text. Any edits needed? 

***

Hi everyone

I miss seeing you on my daily walks.

I am well yet surprised an elder like me can have such new experiences.

I hope this time brings fresh feelings into your life as well.

* know the elderly on you floor
* If you are waiting for an elevator and you see an elderly person already the elevator, do let the door close and allow the elevator to continue without you. Why? The elevators are small, confined not well ventilated spaces. it is not possible to b six feet apart from the next person.

Do not hold the door open for anybody.

Wait for others to get their mail

If you must pick up a news paper or book from the laudry room, use a glove

Wear a glove that you can wash. Soak it in detergent for an hour or so between wearings. The glove will help you not touch your face or scratch where it itches

Isolated mean what it means: Do not go out. Do not leave your apartment. Isolation is not the same thing as staying up past your bed time. Isolation is a way for you to help the city. The longer you tsk to get sick, the better the chance tthere is for you to ge a hospital bed. If we all get sij quick a lot of us ill be taken to tents in a parking lot.

If you are walking down you hall and an elderly person is coming toward you, then go back the way you came. Tr and establish communication, What you do no want to do is pass them in the hall way. Why? The hall way is too narrow and too badly ventilated for the two of you to pass safely.''

If you see two days of newspapers on the floor in front of an apartment, call management. There have been a number of instance over the years where people have been found alive or dead having been unable to move for days.

What do you think of me sending the following message to NextDoor:
Email subject: what is the sound of one hand clapping?

Email body:
Like many of you I am self-isolating. Like many of you I want to thank our health care providers.

At 8 pm, I plan to go out on my balcony. I will clap my hands for a minute to honor the many good efforts by people taking high risks to help others.

Actually, the providers will not hear much from me because my left hand was cut off and sent to heaven years ago.

It would be lovely to have you join me and clap, or stomp, or hoot and holler, let some steam out and make some noise and express hope. Let our thanks spread in the best of ways across the city.
