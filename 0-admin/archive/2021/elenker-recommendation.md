# Elenker

The Elenker upright walker is wonderful mobility aid.

It helps me stand up straighter
The elbow supports help avoids the need for putting extra pressure on my hand and wrist

The large pneumatic wheels do a much better job than solid wheels at abosdrbing the bumps in unlevel pavements and potholes. Large as they are, the walker is highly manouvertable. It turns easily and rolls with little friction.

The lifting seat with basket under is one iof the best walker storage solutions I have experienced.

I am a 74 year old partial paraplegic with amputated left hand. Nonetheless I was able to assemble the walker in les than half an hour

I had an issues with a broken part. Poly and Zoe from Elenker support had a replacement delivered to me in a few days.
