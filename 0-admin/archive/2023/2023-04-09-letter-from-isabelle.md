# Letter from Isabelle

I am in the process of Working with a lawyer to write my will and trust. One of the things she is asking for is a letter from my former wife, stating that.Stating that she will have and has no interest in my estate. I am wondering if you could write a letter for her to sign.

I am not sure what you would need to know to write the letter. I am happy to answer any questions you may have.
