Hi Richard

I have given a lot of thought about our investment in Point65 and Kayakomat. You know that I believe you are doing a good thing and that in general I continue to be an enthusiastic risk taker.

Historically, the months of September and October have often seen downturns in the US stock exchanges, and this year seems to be no exception. Observing a daily decline in our portfolio is quite disheartening. The thought of selling shares now only to witness another dip is far from enticing.

So, for that very basic, very human reason, I am taking our Armour offer to purchase more the shares to maintain our percentage of ownership off the table.

I am still very much interested in the success of Point65 and Kayakomat, and I am still very much interested in investing in the company. I just cannot bring myself to do so at this time.

I hope you understand.
