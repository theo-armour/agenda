# Trust Funding Instructions For The Theo Armour Revocable Trust

In order to carry out one of the objectives of your estate plan—the avoidance of a court-supervised probate administration of your estate at death—you should fund the revocable trust you have established by transferring your assets into the trust. During your lifetime, you retain complete control of, and access to, these assets and retain all beneficial rights relating to them. Upon your death, the trust assets are administered and distributed by the successor trustee in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement.

The following paragraphs describe the transfer process for different types of assets. It is general in nature, and you may not own all of the types of assets discussed, but the information is nonetheless provided in the event that you later acquired a certain type of asset. You may wish to transfer some of your assets yourself. You may wish us to assist with other transfers; in those instances, please send us the information requested.


## Title

For all transfers to your revocable trust, title should be transferred to:

"Norman Armour III, trustee of the Theo Armour Revocable Trust dated July 1, 2023”


## 1. New Assets

All new assets should generally be acquired in the name of the Trust, as shown above.


## 2. Transfers of Stock or Other Registered Securities

If you hold securities in a brokerage account, rather than holding the actual stock certificates, your broker easily can change the account to the trust name, as shown in Items 1 above. If your broker asks for a copy of the entire trust document, we recommend that you instead provide a copy of the Certification of Trust. The Certification provides the pertinent information the broker needs to change the account name, without providing a copy of the trust, which has personal family information.

If you hold your stock certificates directly, your broker should be able to help you transfer title to your stock. If you do not work with a broker, you should contact the transfer agent for each company in which you have stock. (The attorney for a closely-held company often functions as its transfer agent.)  The name and address of the agent can be obtained from any broker. You may want to call each transfer agent to ask what the exact requirements are, as they sometimes vary. Generally, the steps are as follows:

(a) Although you may assign the stock to the trust by completing the back of the certificate itself, this makes the certificate negotiable; we suggest that, instead, you fill out “Assignments Separate from Certificate” (available from any broker). Your name should be
signed exactly as shown on the stock certificate, including any middle names or initials or misspellings.

(b) Your signature on each Assignment must be guaranteed by a bank officer or broker. Contact your own bank for details. (This is not the same as having your signature notarized.)

(c) You also may be required to complete an Affidavit of Domicile; this form may be obtained from your broker.

(d) The original of each stock certificate should be mailed to the transfer agent, together with a letter of instructions referring to the name of the stock, stock certificate number and number of shares and, if required, including the affidavit of Domicile. That letter
should inform the transfer agent that the Assignments are being mailed separately. Send the letter by registered mail, return receipt requested. Send the Assignment in an envelope separate from the stock certificates.

You may expedite this process by having your stock broker transfer stock to a brokerage account in the name of your trust. Although we can assist you with stock transfers, we do not believe it would be cost effective when these transfers can be handled much more inexpensively (possibly even for free) by a broker.


## 3. Transfer of Unregistered Bonds

These should be placed in a safe deposit box opened in the name of the trust (see Item 1).


## 4. Transfer of Cash Accounts

You should change the name of your bank accounts and certificates of deposit by completing new signature cards as Trustee. Your banker should be able to assist you. During your lifetime, the bank may continue to use your Social Security Number as the account’s Taxpayer Identification Number. Again, you should provide the bank with a copy of the Certification of Trust, rather than the entire trust document.


## 5. Retirement Plans and IRAs.

For any retirement plans (such as 401(k) or IRAs), you should name your children as the beneficiaries of these accounts. Presumably, you have done this already but now would be a good time to check. Your financial institution will have forms to complete to name your children as the beneficiaries.


## 6. Real Property - Title Insurance and Casualty and Liability Insurance

If you purchase any real property within the US in the future, you should hold title, as trustee of the revocable trust and all insurance should be in the name of the trust and your name individually as the insured. For any real property you purchase outside of the US, please contact me. We will need to determine from local counsel the best way to dispose of the property on your death (i.e., whether it should be through your trust or under a Will.)


## 7. Transfer of Life Insurance — Designation of Beneficiary

The beneficiary of most life insurance policies should be changed to the trust; however, you may wish to continue the designation of an outright beneficiary or beneficiaries (such as your children) of a small policy, such as a term policy through an employer. Forms for changing the beneficiary of your life insurance policies can be obtained from the insurance companies or your broker. Some insurance companies require that a certified copy of the trust instrument, which we can provide, be submitted to them.

You should continue as owner of the policies on your own life, but the trust should be designated as owner of any policies on the lives of others. If you later acquire a life insurance policy with a large face value (e.g., $5MM or more) you may wish to discuss your policies with us before titling it in the name of the trust.


## 8. Transfer of Partnerships/LLCs

You should title all investments and closely held entities in your name, as trustee of the trust. If you would like us to prepare the assignments to the trust, we will need the Operating Agreement or partnership agreement for each entity. You may also ask the attorney that prepared the Operating Agreement or partnership agreement to prepare the Assignments as well.

If you have any interests in partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships, we will need to review these documents to determine if there are restrictions on transfers; if there are, it may be necessary to amend the partnership agreement before transferring your interest to your trust. For private equity and hedge fund investments, forms will need to be completed to transfer your interest in the name of the trust. If you need any assistant in this regard, please let us know. We will need contact with the respective fund in order to obtain
the forms to complete.

We also will need to determine whether your interest is that of a general or limited partner. In some instances, it may be necessary to transfer your “economic interest” only, rather than have the trust become a substituted partner (the trust still would receive any
income from the partnership).

It usually will be necessary to obtain the consent of the general partner for the transfer, so you should send us current information on how to contact the general partner. We would ask the general partner to do this and to take whatever other steps are necessary to reflect
the transfer on the books of the partnership.


## 9. Vehicles

The DMV has a form to transfer automobiles held in a decedent’s
name without the need for probate, assuming that all non-trust assets (excluding automobiles and certain other assets) total less than $188,250 in value. Accordingly, we do not recommend transferring title of automobiles to the trust. Please contact us for advice if you wish to transfer other vehicles, such as boats or airplanes, to the trust.


## 10. Promissory Notes, Installment Notes and Deeds of Trust

You should send us copies of all unsecured and secured promissory notes, installment notes, and deeds of trust reflecting money owed to you (rather than money you owe). These assets can be transferred to the trust by executing an assignment of the asset and then sending notice to the obligors; in the case of secured notes, the assignment of the deed of trust must be notarized, so that it can be recorded.
