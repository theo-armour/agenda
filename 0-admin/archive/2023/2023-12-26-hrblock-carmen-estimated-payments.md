Subject: 2023 Estimated Tax Payments

Hi Carmen

I hope you are having a good holiday season.

There were some problems with my 2023 estimated tax payments. All the California payments were made as expected, and I have received the refund. There were, however, issues with payments to the IRS. Only a single payment was processed. I have attached a copy of the form CP24 that I received from the IRS. See: 2023-10-30-irs-cp24.pdf

I also attach a copy of the November statement from Pershing bank showing capital gains etc. See: 2023-11-pershing-statement.pdf

From these documents can you help me determine what I need to do to make sure I am up to date with my 2023 estimated tax payments for January 2024?
