Hi Edina and Flora

The October events calendar is out

Heritage is celebrating Oktoberfest on October 6 and Italian Night Dinner on October 20.

Other fun nights are Friday nights which are very well attended because the wine is free.

If you would like to choose one of these evenings this would be great, but any other day or meal is fine too because three meals are served every day, of course.

Also, we can now have any mix of residents and guests up to five people. So, for example, we could invite Pamela Fischer and Marcia Forman to discuss what improvements you might like to see happen in the garden because of your generous and much-appreciated donation.
