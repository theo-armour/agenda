Estimated Tax Payments

Hi Josh

Last year's tax preparation was a bit of a mess forÂ me.

One of the reasons has been the great variance in annual income provoking estimated tax payments that were way off target - both too high and too low.

Adjusted Gross Income
2021: $417,170
2022: $136,823
2023: $239,193

(Last year was particularly troublesome. DWA paid all four of the 2022 California estimated tax payments but only one of the four Federal payments. So I way overpaid California and way underpaid the Federal.)

Can you offer or help me find any advice on estimating and updating the estimated tax payments based on what has happened to the portfolio in the previous quarter?
