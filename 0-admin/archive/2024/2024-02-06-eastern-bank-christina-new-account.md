# 2024-02-06 Eastern Bank Christina New Account

Hi Christina

I now have a revised will & trust. I am also also in the process of paying taxes (soon), paying for teeth implants and setting up a donor advised fund.

Therefore, for the next few quarters would you kindly forward disbursements from the Hovey and Patch trusts to my account at Chase Bank?

Chase Bank has created a new checking account in my name on behalf of the "Theo Armour Revocable Trust dated July 1, 2023".

Chase Bank account

Name: Norman Armour
Account number: 702053203
Routing number: 322271627

I attach a copy of the Certification of Trust.

Cheers,

Theo
