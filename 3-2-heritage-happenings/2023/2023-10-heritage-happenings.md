## Aging in Place

The Health Center closed in April. Almost all the residents moved to Assisted Living in Perry.Resident have settled in. And several have died. there has been enough time to generate some observations regarding the move and subsequent care.
I am not a doctor or nurse. I am a resident. So take my observations with a grain of salt. As part of my exercise program I walk down the 2nd floor hall a ten to 20 times a day. In doing so I have observed the following:
There are currently four patients who require a very significant amount of care. I am pleased to report that they are the care that I wold hope to receive if I were in a similar position. I would like my hair to be washed and combed. My finger nails trimmed. I want to be bathed and washed. I understand that getting me fully dressed every single day is not necessary. I would like to be dressed in clean gowns every day. If I can dress my self but need help, I would like the staff to help me select my clothes. I may need to be fed.

Another aspect of life have observed is end of life. This has been less close. Several residents have entered hospice care and continued to live here. At two were eating meals with their friends in the dining room until just a few days before the end

I am pleased to report that what have observed pleases me. Of course there are issues.People fall. People decline. People die. But I am pleased to report that from my point of view the transfer of residents fro the Health Center to Assisted Living has been a success.


## Robert (Bob) Granucci

Our new resident is a native San Franciscan. Bob spent his first years on Webster Street until the age of 14, when his family moved to Francisco Street between Gough and Octavia. As he said, his life has turned full cycle. He is back on Francisco Street between Octavia and Laguna. However, he covered a lot of territory over his life's journey.
Bob went to St. Ignatius High School, earned his bachelor's degree at the University of San Francisco and then studied law at Stanford University . His career began as a Research Assistant with the California Supreme Court. He later spent 29 years in the criminal division of the California Attorney General's office. He argued, reviewed and assigned cases in the California and federal courts. Bob argued the case of the Berkeley sit-in students in 1964. He argued three cases in the United States Supreme Court.
In addition, Bob has served on the Board of Trustees of USF and on the Board of Regents of St. Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park. He is also a member of The Order of Malta.
Bob's father formulated the recipe for Belfast Old Fashioned MUG Root Beer. He met his wife of forty years at a St. Patrick's Day party. She was a nurse who came from Ireland. She traveled and worked in several other countries before arriving in San Francisco. Their home was a 15-room house in St. Francis Woods. She died in 2011, leaving Bob with a yellow Labrador named Siena. He says: "I lived with a beautiful blonde in a 15-room cottage".
Bob has two sons. The younger, John, lives in San Rafael with his family. There are two grandchildren: Peter who also lives in San Rafael and Theresa who is a student at UC Davis. The other son lives elsewhere.
Hobbies are skeet shooting, hunting and fishing. He regularly traveled to Alaska to fish and to England to hunt. Bob once took first prize in a skeet-shooting event at the World Championships. He is another reader, especially interested in military and naval history; e.g., Samuel Eliot Morrison. He also likes mysteries, citing Alan Furst, as a favorite.
Bob can be found, at present, in Room 420 Perry but will be moving into 303 Perry as soon as it is renovated. His telephone n umber is 415-518-3624.


## A Finnish Holiday

Karina Tapia

By Martha Nell Beatty
Karina is lucky to have had an uncle with a home in Helsinki on the Gulf of the Baltic Sea. After owning his home for over 40 years, he was planning to sell it, So Karina’s mother, who was born in Finland, her two daughters and her sister and her family decided they needed to plan a trip to visit him one last time. During much of her childhood, Karina visited her uncle every other year and it had been years since the family was all gathered in the home.

The house, Villa Tallvik, was built in the Jugend style in 1907. It’s architect Selim A Lindqvist was foremost in his field with many of his buildings following the Art Nouveau style. An antique dealer installed pieces from the passenger ship, M/S Bore in the house, including mahogany walls and floors, adding special touches. The house is architecturally, historically, and environmentally valuable and has heritage protection.

The house is set in a forest making it perfect for hiking and picking all kinds of berries and mushrooms including chanterelles. The home has a private beach with a boat dock and sauna built by Karina’s uncle. (There are two other saunas on the property.) Karina and her daughters enjoy warming up in the hot sauna and then plunging into the Baltic Sea to swim. They also boat and fish off the dock. After catching trout, they prepare it for dinner accompanied by freshly picked vegetables that are grown on the property.

Sadly, it was the family’s last stay in this idyllic place but not the last time they will go to Finland!



## Margaret Johnson #2

You may remember from some issues ago that I started a memoir about rooms I have lived in over the past 80+ years. I recounted how, right out of high school, I moved away from my home in Salem, NJ, and took a job as a telephone operator in Bridgeton, NJ.
PHILADELPHIA (the first time)
I left Bridgeton in early 1943, not wanting to be trapped in a business likely to be deemed “essential to the war effort,” for a job with a bank in Philadelphia (not “essential,” it seemed). I spent a lot of time and shoe leather looking for a place to live – even, unwittingly, looking in the ‘red-light district’ at one point, but kindly directed elsewhere by a landlady who understood my confusion. Then I ran into a friend from Salem who was enrolled at a secretarial school in the city that provided apartments for out-of-town students. Florence offered to share it with me -- one room, Murphy-bed in the wall, closet-sized kitchen, and all. It had a telephone that the school had forgotten about, and we were able to get it connected, which was a great coup during the War, when phones were impossible to get.
When Florence finished her courses we had to leave, so I moved on. I shared a house in West Philadelphia with friends for the summer and then moved into a rooming-house out near the University of Pennsylvania. Florence had now taken my former place at the bank filing checks all day, enabling me to move up to a better (somewhat more interesting) job in the Trust Department. She moved into another room in the same rooming house, so during that miserable, cold winter I shared a largish room with Marty, a young woman from Maine who had come down for a defense job.
Marty and I got along well, but the circumstances were pretty bad. We all used the kitchen in that rooming house, but food stored in the refrigerator tended to disappear and other users didn't clean up - all the usual problems of shared space. The landlady only had one set of sheets for each bed. If the weather were good, she would take ALL the sheets and wash them -- they were always a bit damp when she returned them. I came down with the flu that winter -- they called it 'the grippe' then, every bit as unpleasant as flu. Marty turned out to be a real friend and we were able to move across the street into a real apartment in the spring. It was newly restored and furnished, clean and bright. We talked Florence into sharing the rent -- as long as she went home on the weekends and washed the dishes when she was with us.
But life in Philadelphia, with the men all gone, was pretty drab (I am not talking about the men in the bank’s office – they were all middle-aged, too old for the draft, except one, who was drafted at age 34) – and they were all a bit depressed at having to stay behind. They loved having me there, a bright spot in their dull lives, I realize now. There was no one to go out dancing with, or even to the movies, and Philadelphia was quite dull, with its Blue Laws -- all bars closed Saturday night at midnight and stayed closed all day Sunday. And there was no live music anywhere on Sunday -- all the Big Bands had to go across the Delaware to Camden on Sundays. Occasionally, someone came home on leave – I remember tea dances at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel and too many drinks at lunch before taking the train to New York for the weekend; there were, obviously, some men around.
There were, I realize now, always men around, just not the ones I wanted, I guess. So, in time, I decided to leave the bank and go to New York. And that was the big move that changed my life – more on that next time!


## My Aunt Helen
By Doris Howard
My Aunt Helen Sobel was a famous bridge player in the 1940s - 1950s. Bridge was an increasingly popular card game in those days. She made it her career, participating in national and international tournaments. She was called "the greatest woman bridge player in the world" (still on the internet). Her frequent partner was Charles Goren, who was more famous than she. On one occasion, she and Charlie had won a tournament. They were being interviewed afterward. She was asked how it felt to partner wth the best bridge player in the world. She replied: "I don't know. Ask Charlie."
She married my uncle when I was 9 or 10 years old . We had frequent contact - it was a close family. She divorced my uncle after about ten years of marriage but I continued to see her. She maintained a friendship with my uncle and still came to family gatherings.
She belonged to a private bridge club, the Cavendish, an elegant building bought and maintained by members. Occasionally,when I could go on a Sunday afternoon, she invited me to go downtown to observe her play. It was a common thing to do, sit at a player's elbow. For me, It was a learning experience and great entertainment. One time, I saw her get two hours of bad cards. She was so skillful that she was the big winner at the end. She prevented the other players with better hands from winning. They played for money and she won.
To me, this was a mysterious and sophisticated world of magical people. I knew some of them by name and saw their names in the newspaper bridge columns. Helen was a star in her small world for several years. Another ten yeas later, she married again and retired to Florida.



## The Shelter
By Jane Standing

At the beginning of World War 11 the next door neighbor and my father built an air raid shelter. We lived in a small commuter town east of London. It was at the end of the District Underground Line. There were also steam trains which were much more fun. I was 9 years old going on 10.

My father and our neighbor dug a big hole at the bottom of our two gardens. Then they had corrugated iron panels bent at one end - government issue I’m sure. These they put in the hole with the bent ends up to form a roof and piled all the earth they had dug up on top. It was quite cozy. The four adults had old car seats to sit on while I had a very narrow bench to supposedly sleep on. There was a spirit stove to make tea and a tin of biscuits (cookies). I expect they all smoked

I would be woken by the sound of the siren and dressed in an old pair of somebody’s jodhpurs and a sweater would be ready to dash to the bottom of the garden and the shelter. We sometimes had to wait as there would be shrapnel falling from the guns near by. My father was not always with us as he was a Fire Spotter and an Air Raid Warden. When the All Clear sounded we would stagger up the garden and go to bed for what was left of the night. We always dreaded moonlight nights as not being far from the Thames the German planes followed the river in to London.

One Sunday afternoon there was a daylight raid. We were all in the shelter and suddenly all the adults got out telling me to stay put. Of course I followed them to witness dog fights going on above us and planes falling from the sky.

There was a shelter at school which I was only in once before we moved away. I will never forget the smell of wet concrete and wooden duck boards. There was a bucket behind a curtain in case you had to ‘go’. Nobody did of course.

One day the Gas Hut came to school to test the community. You would go in with your gas mask on to make sure that it was functioning properly and then you were told to take it off so you would know what gas smelt like. Everyone came out gasping and spluttering with eyes running.

We did have shrapnel through the roof and lots of incendiary bombs all around but nothing compared to what other people had to endure.

Soon after this we moved away from London which is another story.

## The Book of Charlie: Wisdom from the Remarkable American Life of a 109-Year-Old Man

By David Von Drehle An inspirational biography.

Review by Trish Otstott

"When a veteran Washington journalist moved to Kansas, he met a new neighbor who was more than a century old. Little did he know that he was beginning a long friendship—and a profound lesson in the meaning of life. Charlie White was no ordinary neighbor. Born before radio, Charlie lived long enough to use a smartphone. When a shocking tragedy interrupted his idyllic boyhood, Charlie mastered survival strategies that reflect thousands of years of human wisdom.

Thus armored, Charlie's sense of adventure carried him on an epic journey across the continent, and later found him swinging across bandstands of the Jazz Age, racing aboard ambulances through Depression-era gangster wars, improvising techniques for early open-heart surgery, and cruising the Amazon as a guest of Peru's president.

David Von Drehle came to understand that Charlie's resilience and willingness to grow made this remarkable neighbor a master in the art of thriving through times of dramatic change. As a gift to his children, he set out to tell Charlie's secrets.

The Book of Charlie is a gospel of grit—the inspiring story of one man's journey through a century of upheaval. The history that unfolds through Charlie's story reminds you that the United States has always been a divided nation, a questing nation, an inventive nation—a nation of Charlies in the rollercoaster pursuit of a good and meaningful life."

## Fort Mason Community Garden

By Margaret Missiaen

The Fort Mason Community Garden, established in 1976, is located in upper Fort Mason. The garden operates in partnership with the Nation Park Service and has 120 member plots on 1.3 acres. The average plot is about 80 square feet.

Each member pays an annual fee to cover the costs of water, plot building and tools. Members are also expected to attend workdays 4 times a year to maintain common areas. The garden is managed by a Board of Directors drawn from the membership. Currently the waitlist has almost 200 names and has been closed until the list is reduced.

The garden gates are open to the public. Visitors are encouraged to stop by anytime to enjoy the plants, watch the migrating birds and keep an eye out for the resident coyote. To find the garden, enter at Franklin and Bay Streets, stay to the left of the chapel and you will see the garden on your left. Street parking is usually available as are several handicapped spaces.

Although I realize with such a change there will be hiccups, we all need to work together in making this the best place to age in San Francisco. My hopes for the future of the Heritage are that residents age successfully, the place remains vibrant, and that I would be a future resident myself!” --Laura Wagner
Laura has shared a reading list that is specific to aging in our world today.
