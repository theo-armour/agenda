Enjoy, and while you are it please note that all the text is edited so it just fills the page but does not escape the pages made of paper. Oh, the ongoing challenges of living in a non-fully digital world! ;-)

Happy Year of the Dragon!

This issue contains my third editorial on Aging in Place. I am trying to keep the topic in front of us. This month, the concept of levels of care was introduced - in relation to residents on the Type C Contract. We look into what this means in more detail in the coming months.

The Around the World Country for February is China. There are four events planned to celebrate the Year of the Dragon. In the newsletter, Sheila Moore reports on her visit to Taiwan in 1966 taken from her diary with text and drawings.

Happy Year of the Dragon!

It's with much gratitude that I can report that Randy Gridley and Mary Linde presented a detail and engaging seminar on the Strategic Plan to a "full-house" of residents on January 11th. The feedback was very positive.

Happy Year of the Dragon!
