Hi Vivien,

Thank your for sending me the Pricing and Amenity sheet.

I am in the process of writing an article for the March Heritage Happenings newsletter regarding the Levels of Care provided by Heritage on the Marina,

I have a two questions. I hope you can help me. If not, can you direct me to someone who can?

1. Are there any monthly prices available for Independent Living residents who need some amenities but not enough to boost to a higher level of care? Here are some examples of what I mean, but you may have others. What might be the monthly price for someone who needs:

* Weekly personal laundry
* Daily bed making and trash removal
* Assistance with showering

2. Can you provide any examples of what types of services might be typical for different levels of care? I understand that care at higher levels oif care may be quite complicated, but the article is supposed to be simple. ;-)

So, perhaps two pr three simple example of what might be included in the lower levels of care would be very helpful.
