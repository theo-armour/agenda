We added a new feature this month: asking residents for short quotes or comments relating to the country being highlighted this month - Ireland. See "Residents Potpourri of Irish Tidbits". It turns out residents do this easily. Much easier than trying to get a full story. To be continued with Greece next month.

The Heritage Happenings Residents Directory was not updated this month.

This issue contains my third editorial on Aging in Place. I am trying to keep the topic in front of us. This month, the concept of levels of care was introduced - in relation to residents on the Type C Contract. We look into what this means in more detail in the coming months.

The Around the World Country for March is China. There are four events planned to celebrate the Year of the Dragon. In the newsletter, Sheila Moore reports on her visit to Taiwan in 1966 taken from her diary with text and drawings.

Happy Year of the Dragon!
