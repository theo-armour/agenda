# Travels around Ireland in June 2008
By Sheila Moore

In 2008 I took a trip to Ireland. The folling images and text are excerpts from my travel journal.

We had an orientation drive in a Belfast this is the red brick Queens University we were told that the civil war or "troubles" were over. we saw the left over fence in the falls Hill road section separated militant Catholics and Protestants.

Giants causeway formed by a volcanic eruption eons ago, which cooled very slowly and formed these pilings of stones. I was thrilled to see it as seen many magazine photographs. this stones are hexagons and foreign piles. Giants causeways along the northern Antrim coast. Scotland is only 37 mi distant


we drove southerly and crossed the river Shannon estuary by ferry. lovely pastoral green scenery looking out to Tralee and the Atlantic Ocean. there are flocks of sheep everywhere in Ireland, and so it's green as it rains a lot.

we we set off to tour the ring of Kerry. me and a shop holding a complimentary Irish coffee, at 9:00 a.m.! lovely Willems and cashmere in all the shops.

you lie on your back, that men support you, and you kiss the Barney Stone upside down. when it came to my turn I could see the ground way down below, and I chickened out. I did kiss the bony stone 40 years ago however on my first visit to Ireland. inside the room that is Blondie Castle. to reach this elevated spot I had to climb on all fours up a narrow narrow spiral staircase and a separate spiral staircase down. it was very difficult for me at 72 years old!

we had a pub evening at this cozy satch is that true pub near tramore. The pub had a burning fireplace, and adjoining bedroom where wakes are held. basically a drinking party with speeches and eulogies honoring the dead person line on the bed .

approaching blarney Castle. it is basically a ruin, kept alive by the ritual of kissing the blarney Stone, which is supposed to bestow quotes the gift of gab quotes.

we drove to glendello with its ruins of a center of Irish antiquity Christianity founded by St Kevin. The tall round tower was used as a defensive hiding place by the monks and is beautifully preserved. I climb it around the age of gravestones. The monks were ravaged by marauding Vikings. Will preserved ruins of an Abbey and a path leading to a beautiful lake.

typical example of an Irish pub, pubs are everywhere.

I found the area in the center of Dublin that had many Irish music bars. Dublin is attractive with all the flower bowls. The temple bar this was featured in an article on the pubs of Dublin in our Sunday chronicle recently. I went inside the temple bar pub and it was busy even at noon. I had a half pint of beer for 3.6.0 Euros $5.50. these men are drinking full pints of Guinness. Dublin is full of pubs

Dublin. Statue of Malone featured in the Irish ballad of that name.

We stopped at Dingle, a small town for lunch. main Street of Dingle with Murphy's pub. typical Irish pub you see all across Ireland in June it is warm and sunny, and patron sit outside


We spent the afternoon driving at 32 Mile Slea Head drive around the Dingle peninsula. We passed many of these beehive dwellings built of native stones many centuries ago, used by Pilgrims for meditation

We drove in a drizzle to see the clips of mohar, county Clare. I walked to the cliff edge in rain but it was so fogged in that I could not distinguish the eclipse at all, so I bought this postcard to see what they look like. The cliffs are more rice 702 ft above the Atlantic. as soon as we left the visibility cleared

We spent an evening at the Guinness storehouse, which is a giant brewery right in the center of Dublin. We were showed the giant bats and the processes. then on the rooftop of Guinness brewery we were treated to complimentary pints. This is John Hood our team director.


## Ritz and Escoffier: The Hotelier, The Chef, and the Rise of the Leisure Class ~ 2028 ~ NF
Reviewed by Trish Otstott
If you enjoy reading books about Paris, London, haute cuisine, opulence and scandal, then you need to read this book!
César Ritz and his Master Chef partner, Auguste Escoffier, were lured from Baden-Baden to London in 1899. Their mission was to turn the Savoy Hotel into the finest hotel in the world and they did it. This book includes stories of managing all aspects of a luxury hotel, handling important or Royal guests, creating and serving fine cuisine and then skimming off the top, what?
Ritz and Escoffier retreated to Paris where Ritz was finally able to establish his own hotel under his own name at 15 Place Vendôme.
I appreciated learning about Ritz and his exhausting efforts to create perfection in the hotel itself, and his working alongside Escoffier who created sensational perfection in the elevated original dishes he prepared. One of Escoffier’s most famous new dishes was Peach Melba created and named in honor of the Australian opera singer, Nellie Melba.


## Ladies Protection and Relief Society and Nancy Drew

Martha Nell Beatty

Recently I looked up the Ladies Protection and Relief Society on line and this is what I found:

“The Ladies Protection & Relief Society was an organization designed to provide a home for struggling widows and orphans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries near San Francisco, California. Despite controversy, the women eventually decided to raise money for the Society by performing plays, which may have been why Lizzie Applegate, being a playwriter herself loved so much and arranged in her will for the money that would buy her liquidated estate to go towards it.”

This is from “Message in a Haunted Mansion,” which is part of a Nancy Drew series of adventure video games. In it Lizzie Applegate appears as a ghost. She was a real singer/playwright in San Francisco in 19th century. San Francisco.

Of course, our official name is San Francisco Ladies’ Protection and Relief Society and and were founded in 1848 in the heart of San Francisco. Perhaps Lizzie did have something to do with our organization.

I can’t believe the Nancy Drew, a heroine of my youth, has emerged in a different form
