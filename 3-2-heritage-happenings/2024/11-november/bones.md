## Why be concerned about bone and joint health

- Muscles, joints, and bones are vital to movement and allow us to accomplish feats such as walking, exercising, and dancing, as well as simple things like writing, using a computer, hugging a loved one.
- Maintaining bone and joint health is critical to keeping an active lifestyle and aging in place.

## Why be concerned about bone and joint health

- Bones provide our basic body structure; joints are connections between bones that allow the flexibility of movement, and muscles hold them together and facilitate simple and complex movements.
- Proper care of muscles, joints, and bones now helps ensure strength and mobility as we age and may mean the difference between growing old actively or sedentarily.

## Anatomy

- Joints are composed of bones, cartilage, and a joint capsule containing synovial fluid. Problems can occur with any of these structures due to injury, wear and tear, and illness.

## Bone and Joint Disease Facts

- 54 percent of the American population over the age of 18 are affected by musculoskeletal bone and joint conditions, according to *The Burden of Musculoskeletal Conditions in the United States.*
- One in three people over the age of 18 required medical care for a musculoskeletal condition each year.
- Bone and joint conditions are the most common cause of long-term pain and physical disability worldwide, affecting hundreds of millions of people.

## More Bone and Joint Disease Facts

- Musculoskeletal conditions include back pain, arthritis, traumatic injuries, osteoporosis, spinal deformity, and childhood conditions.
- The global prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions is predicted to increase due to increasing life expectancy and changes in risk factors.
- Musculoskeletal conditions can lead to significant disability plus diminished productivity and quality of life.

## More Bone and Joint Disease Facts

- Research funding is currently less than 2 percent of the National Institutes of Health annual budget and continues to decline each year despite the high costs associated with arthritis, arthritis, and back pain.
- Since 2011, when “Baby Boomers” became beneficiaries of Medicare, the economic and societal cost of bone and joint health escalated and is expected to continue for decades.

## Common Bone and Joint Problems

Many people over the age of 65 have bone and joint health problems that cause inflammation, pain and deformities in their hips, knees, fingers and other areas. People with weakening bones and joints may stop participating in activities like they used to. When a senior is aging in place, leading a sedentary lifestyle can quickly place their freedom and independence at risk.

## Common Bone and Joint Problems

- **Broken Bones**: As bones lose calcium and other essential minerals during the aging process or from osteoporosis, they get more brittle and break more easily. This can be complicated by balance problems and falling.
- **Arthritis**: Age or activity-related wearing away of the cartilage within the joints is a cause for arthritis which is manifested by joint pain and swelling. Two common types of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
- **Osteoporosis**: As bone resorption exceeds replacement, bones can become weak and brittle resulting in fractures and postural changes.

## Common Bone and Joint Problems

- **Fear of falling**: Fear of falling has been identified as a common problem for our seniors. Weak bones and inflexible joints cause balance issues that may place a senior at risk for bumping into stationary objects or falling.
- **Muscle weakness**: When muscles aren’t used enough because of inactivity, they weaken and atrophy. The body replaces depleted muscle tissue with tough fibrous tissue. This ongoing cycle causes further muscle deterioration that can even make a senior feel fatigued.

## Nutrition

- Eating a diet that’s rich in essential vitamins and minerals has been shown to drastically improve bone and joint health in elderly patients. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D helps maintain bone density. Vitamin D also acts as an anti-inflammatory with regards to joint pain, as do the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, such as tuna and salmon. Taking supplements like glucosamine and chondroitin may help reduce joint tightness and swelling, which will enhance flexibility.
- Ensuring that you have plenty of vegetables, fresh fruits, lean proteins and whole grains, and limiting your intake of foods that are processed or high in sugar, salt or carbohydrates will lead to improved bone and joint health.

## Maintain a Healthy Weight

- For many people, staying at a healthy weight is difficult.
- Maintaining a healthy weight decreases the pressure on our joints and prevents inflammation of joint tissue as it degrades over time. Limiting fat intake from other sources will not only aid in maintaining a healthy weight, but it also keeps fatty tissues from developing in muscles, which weakens them.
- Regular exercise and healthy eating habits are the best ways to maintain a healthy weight.

---
## Sleep

- The human body functions optimally when getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep every day.
- While sleeping soundly, our bodies produce substances that help repair inflamed joint and muscle tissues.
- Getting enough daily activity and maintaining a consistent sleep schedule are good ways to ensure healthy sleep habits.

---

## Medication

- Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen can help relieve joint pain associated with arthritis or overuse, and there are prescription medications available that help prevent further bone loss due to osteoporosis.
- Be sure to consult with your physician before starting any medication regimen.
