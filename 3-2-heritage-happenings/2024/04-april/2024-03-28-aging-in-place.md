All residents should review and understand their contract, whether Type A or Type C.  If there is any confusion about services offered, exclusions, “What Ifs”, under each contract type, residents should reach out to management

residents that currently reside in their units in most apartments can receive “Aging in Place” services. For Type A residents these fees are inclusive in the monthly care fees.  For Type C residents these services are based on “ala-carte” services or level of care assisting living additional charges.

Continuing Care Services range from Assessment to Extra Housekeeping to Meals in your apartment and to certain activities of daily living.  Once a resident moves beyond needing some of the more simple assistance, they would switch to a Level of Care.   The level of care is determined through a point process and what the resident can and cannot do on their own as well as some other factors.  Once a level of care is determined, an appropriate a care plan is worked out with the resident, and family members if needed, to support the resident with those needs.




Hi Jon

Regarding fee schedules for Independent Living Aging in Place Levels of Care, as far as I know, no pricing sheet is available.

I attach a copy of the pricing sheet that has been distributed to residents. You will note that pricing is included for Private Pay Assisted Living levels of care and for Continuing Care Assisted Living levels of care.  In both of these instances I assume that the pricing assumes that a resident occupies one of the designated Assisted-Living units. There is also a "Service Fee Schedule" for Type C residents that lists the costs of various individual services that are available to residents.

If, however, you do the math of, say, skin care treatment ($45), assistance getting to the dining room ($50), assistance to restroom ($50), additional cleaning service ($45) multiplied by thirty days a month, the costs run up to $6K - and these are just very basic items. Using this as a guide, it is easy to see how the costs of Aging in Place services can quickly escalate to levels that a number of residents could not afford.

What the fee schedule does not cover are the prices for Independent Living Aging in Place "levels of care" in their original residences. Also there is no mention of pricing of the different levels of care for residents in different types of units - studio, one & two bedroom, the flats, etc.

Can you you provide any guidance for the pricing of various "levels of care" for independent living residents in their original residences?
