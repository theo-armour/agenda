## Residents Council

The March Madness fund raiser is off to a good start and there are still squares that are available to buy.

The winner of the pool will depend on the result of the final game and its scores.

The final will be played sometime in early April and we will be able to declare a winner.

You can buy squares for friends and relatives. You don't just have to buy squares for yourself.

However you can't buy squares for staff members.

We are also planning a tea to be held in the Morgan Parlor. This will be an elegant affair like last year. Champagne will be served. The date of the Tea will be the afternoon of May 23 and tickets will go on sale in mid April. Owing to spacing there will only be 40 places available.

Sincerely

Patrick Alexander

President Residents' Council.

## Sheila

HaHa, Yes, I felt overwhelmed when I found that file too.  But I'm sorry, that was so long ago, and as an 88 year old senior, I have lost specific memory of those islands.  I do remember going from Israel to one of the islands, it was a two night trip, and to save money I went "deck class" - I slept on the hard wooden deck with no blankets!
I was travelling the world on $5-$6 a day for two years length at a time!  I remember in Greece it was full of ancient Roman ruins (genuine ones).  They have Roman ruins too all along the northern coast of Africa!!

Just pick the best ruins and feature them, and casually attach an island name to
them, as I don't think anyone here at the Heritage has seen them all as I did.
Going around the islands was absolute fun, as tourists and local people con-
gregate at the coastline where there are clusters of bars and restaurants, at 5 o'clock every night and take a table and stay there all evening, until 10 or 11pm, drinking sake mostly.
I got addicted to ouzo, I had to have it every day, starting at 5pm!
I still tell everyone that to have a really good time, travel to the Greek Islands!

My favorite islands were  (if I remember correctly) Santorini and Mykonos.  They
have large daily ferries that travel between the islands, and when you get off
at the island of your choice, all the housekeepers with rooms to rent congregate
on the pier and hold up photos of the rooms they have to rent, sometimes
including breakfast if I recall.  So you barter with them.  They were cheap too
in those days, probably $5 a day!

Visit Greece? You must be kidding. it's in ruins.

Golden Gate National Recreation Area

1972 - October 27 - President Nixon signed “An Act to Establish the Golden Gate National Recreation Area,” (Public Law 92-589 introduced by Rep Phillip Burton), which established the GGNRA. Bill allocated $61,610,000 for land acquisition and $58,000,000 for development.

The Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the nation's largest national park in an urban area, encompasses nearly 81,000 acres. Spanning Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo Counties, Golden Gate National Recreation Area also includes areas such as Alcatraz Island, Muir Woods National Monument, Fort Point National Historic Site, Presidio of San Francisco, and the Marin Headlands.

Fort Mason, once an historic army post located at the edge of the San Francisco Bay, is the headquarters for both the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.

Paved, accessible trails connect Fort Mason's upper and lower units. In between, the Great Meadow slopes down from upper Fort Mason to the Marina. These grassy hilltops and hollows are great for picnicking, sunbathing, walking, or sports activities. The meadow also offers wonderful views of San Francisco's hilly skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge.

There are many beaches to enjoy and explore in Golden Gate including Stinson Beach, Muir Beach, Tennessee Valley Beach, Rodeo Beach, Baker Beach and Ocean Beach.

TIME AND PLACEleanor: LUNCH IN THE HERITAGE DINING ROOM

BarBarb: "I didn't know you grew up on a farm too!"
Eleanor: "We always had a milk cow and raised a baby calf for beef. It wouldn't be a subsistence farm* without chickens for eggs and Sunday dinners.  85% of the 100 baby chicks purchased each spring ended up in the freezer and on the dining room table; the rest were kept as laying hens. We raised pigs for pork; goats to keep vegetation in check.
BarBarb: "We had a small backyard farm. We also had a milk cow and a baby calf raised to eat. My mother took care of gathering eggs from the laying hens and preparing the rest for the freezer. My responsibility was taking care of the goats. We had 6-10 of them at a time, raised as another source of meat. Goats are wonderful creatures. They are calm with a playful mischievous streak. They nuzzle you for attention. They might shove their heads under your hand to make sure they get petted. The small baby goats, especially the male species, can often be found getting ready to butt you in the rear. All it takes is a glare and wave of the hand to get rid of the offender. The goats were staked out in the field during the day. Their food source was anything that grew."
Eleanor: "Speaking of food sources, we had huge vegetable gardens, a potato field, strawberries and raspberries. We knew the best places to pick blueberries and black berries in our small rural town. I can picture you and your siblings shelling peas, snapping beans and shucking corn, ya?"
BarBarb: "Raising farm animals and growing our own food was my father's assurance he could feed our family during the Depression. He was a carpenter; work was not predictable. Dad built the house we lived in, one room at a time. The main room had a large fireplace, the only source of heat. We all lived in that room until my father added other rooms, starting with the room for my parents."
Eleanor: My father grew up on a dairy farm where he learned skills for survival. If any of his eleven children complained about work to be done, his retort was always: "It builds character." Dad survived the Depression because he could drive a team of oxen. Trees that had been knocked down during a hurricane, needed to be taken to the nearby sawmill. Dad got the job. He too was a carpenter, building houses until arthritic knees kept him off ladders. At that point he became a cabinet maker.
BarBarb: We definately learned the value of work. My goats depended on me. And our family depended on the goats for food.
Eleanor: That was my experience too, Barbara. I describe my life as abundant; not based on money in the bank but real food, meaningful work,
resilience- and yes, character!

Barb: "I didn't know you grew up on a farm too!"
Eleanor: "It was a subsistence farm. We had a cow for milk and raised a calf for beef. Every Spring we replenished our poultry stock with 100 adorable baby chicks. Twelve would become 'setting hens' for our daily egg supply. The rest ended up in the freezer for roast chicken dinners. The two baby pigs grew up to be hogs supplying us with the best roast pork, pork chops, sausage (yum!). The goats kept vegetation mowed to the ground. On what do goats graze? Anything that grows!"
Barb. "We had a small backyard farm. We also had a milk cow and a baby calf raised to become meat for the family. My mother took care of gathering eggs from the laying hens and preparing the young poulets for the freezer. My responsibility was taking care of the goats. We had 6-8 at a time, raised as another source of meat. Goats are wonderful creatures.
They are calm with a playful mischievous streak. They nuzzle you for attention. They might shove their heads under your hands to make sure they get petted. The small baby goats, especially the male species, might be found getting ready to butt  you in the behind. All it took was a glare and wave of your hand to dissuade the offender. My job was to take the goats out to pasture before I left for school in the morning and bring them home again after school. I  was known as the 'goat girl' in the neighborhood."
Eleanor. "To keep our family fed Dad planted huge vegetable gardens, a potato field, strawberries, and raspberries. I think rhubarb grew on its own. In our small rural town we knew the best places to pick blueberries and blackberries. Mom and my older sisters would can and freeze enough vegetables and fruit to last until the next harvest. Labor intensive; delicious results. Barbara, I can picture you and your siblings pitching in-Shelling peas, snapping beans, shucking corn, ya?"
Barb: "Ya. Farm work is never done. There is always something that  needs to be done, whether it is caring for the animals or picking the crops when ripened. We had two peach trees and a plum tree. My mother would freeze the fruit."
Eleanor: "You and I were fortunate that our fathers, carpenters during the Depression when jobs were scarce, kept our families fed. We quickly learned the value of working together, and to this day we are able to appreciate our farm to table existence!"

## Margaret M
The seed planting workshop took place in Friendship Hall on March 20. Jeanne supplied the planting kits, Kay Narron supplied the soil and Margaret Missiaen supplied the seeds. Nancy Ozsogomonyan and Kay Tim helped with the planting. Fifteen pots of seeds including nasturtium, morning glory, pot marigold and cosmos were placed on the window to germinate. A week later some of the seeds had germinated. The next seed planting will take place on April 11.

## Jon Casey


I phoned 415-202-0308 a couple of times today but received no call back. Do I have the right number for you?

Iam trying to write an editorial for the next issue of the Heritage Happenings. It's a continuation of a serries on Aging in Place. I would like to include some information on the levels of care for independent living residents with Type-C contracts (ILR/C). I have a few questions that I would like to ask you.

Are there any ILR/C residents currently receiving anything similar to assisting-living levels of care?

Will independent living residents who are aging in place be supported by five levels of care in a manner similar to assisted-living residents?

What is the typical pricing policy for the levels of care for ILR/C residents?

What are typical services provided to ILR/C residents at the different levels of care?


## Flora Zagorites

Flora was married to Jerry Zagorites- a man raised in a traditional Greek family. After shopping one day, Flora returned home and heard Jerry's Uncle Leo exclaim. "Jerry, you let a woman have the money?" Jerry replied, "Uncle Leo, she's a better shopper than I am".
