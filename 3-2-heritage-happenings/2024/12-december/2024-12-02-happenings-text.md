# Val & Tom

Val Szigeti and Tom King
By Martha Nell Beatty

On December 15,1956, teenage Val and her parents walked for four hours in the middle of the night from repressive Communist Hungary to Austria--and freedom. They had joined a ten -person group of emigrees (including a ten-day old baby). Their journey started with a train ride from Budapest to the border. The small group hid while everyone disembarked the train. Finally, they got off surreptitiously and in the dark of night met their guide. Upon arriving in Austria, they were taken to a refugee camp outside Vienna.
It was at the American Embassy in Vienna that Val’s mother sorted out her American citizenship. which she had forfeited by being forced to vote in Hungry. When it was restored, Val was granted American citizenship. Her Hungarian father would have to wait a few years to obtain his. Finally on February 1,1957, they flew from Munich to La Guardia on a US Air Force prop plane. After a stay in army barracks at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, Val and her father (both non- English speaking )- were allowed to leave for her grandparents’ house in Carteret, New Jersey. Her mother wasn’t able to join them until May 1 because of ill health.
Val attended Tufts University, where she majored in physics. After graduating, she worked for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Where they tracked man-made objects in space using Control Data Corporation computers. Later Val worked on establishing a computer network between three universities: Michigan State, Michigan, and Wayne State. That is where she met Tom, who was the protect manager for the company providing the hardware.
Tom was born in Indiana but moved to Michigan and then DC, where his father was in the State Department. When Tom was eight his father was assigned to Bogota, Columbia for two years, which was followed by another two years in Costa Rica. Tom’s father left the State Department and became head pf the Modern Languages Department at Cornell in Ithaca, New York before moving back to the University of Michigan as a professor of linguistics.
Tom attended University of Michigan in an honor’s program and earned a BA and MA in mathematics simultaneously While going to school, he also had a job as an engineer at a start-up company. During this time Tom was sent to Vietnam as a civilian defense contractor to work on a helicopter problem. Upon his return, Tom decided to cash in his scholarship money and buy a race car. He started winning a fair number of races, which led Chrysler to ask him to join their factory team as a professional. At first, he was a co-driver for champion Scott Harvey. They won a big international event their first year and then Chrysler sent them all over the world to compete.
After three years of Tom racing and being an engineer, Tom and Val decided to move to California, where their first home was in Los Gatos. They later built a house in Saratoga. Tom became active in Silicon Valley tech companies including Measurex for 15 years (mostly as a VP Engineering) as it became a New York Stock Exchange company.. He then joined a company in Livermore that was threatened with a hostile takeover attempt by Michael Milken, who later became a neighbor of the company—in the FeI Institution in Dublin, Ca. After the company performed a leveraged re-capitalization went on to a number of start -ups in Silicon Valley and later became a consultant.
Meanwhile while they were in Silicon Valley, Control Data Corporation was eager to offer Val a job and she eventually became head of network design. With two young sons, Val found it difficult to work fulltime so she converted to part time. When she and Tom moved to the East Bay, Val obtained a teaching certificate. With that in hand, she started her own tutoring company, tutored high school and college students in math and science and developed software for teaching math. Val also volunteered at a homeless center in Walnut Creek and tutored ESL.
After their sons were in college, Tom got back into racing—but not as a professional. He became a three-time national Open Road racing champion and still holds some road racing records. He competed in four Special Stage events in Mexico on paved roads. The longest race he was in Chihuahua, Mexico. It was 1,000 miles over a three- day period in the mountains. Val was in charge of the support car for the event.
Tom had written technical articles about race car driving for national publications. But he has found writing fiction fun. As he says, “You can just make stuff up.” For Tom fiction writing is a “voyage of discovery,” His first book was “Rewards for Justice,” which Val says is his best. His three book Death Series includes” Death Ray,” “Death Warrant” and Death Trap”, all of which he has donated to the Stucky Library.
Before writing a book, he develops an extensive back story for every character. When he starts to write a scene, he puts these characters into a situation and lets them interact with each other and react to the circumstances. At the end of the scene Tom sometimes says, “Wow. I didn’t know that was going to happen.”
Currently Tom designs and builds race computers. He sells them to people who used to be his competitors and now they are his customers. He solves programming problems and tries to make the computers better.
You won’t see Tom in his racing car (except in the video below) but you might catch Val on her tricycle on an early morning ride.
Following is a link to an in-car video of one of the special stages in Tom’s Chihuahua event about 12 years ago. Join Tom as he drives faster than you may have ever experienced but less than his car’s top speed of 200 miles per hour.

The Volcano Daughters by Gina Maria Balibrera ~ 2024 ~ Fiction
Book review by Doris Howard

https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nvYXeSCuL._SY522_.jpg

Izalco — a volcano with a small community built on its slopes — this is the setting. This new novel follows the lives of two sisters from this community who are separated and reunited repeatedly. The story is told by a quartet of 'fantasmas', their grandmothers — with occasional commentary that enriches the narrative. It is a complex story about the exploitation of an impoverished people, women's roles, and racism, all packaged in a colorful. beautifully-written book. It addresses old issues with different slants on transcendance, successes arising from apparent losses. The author presents complex characters in depth; their thoughts, feelings and individual personalities. The narrative is sprinkled with Spanish words and expressions, which can be understood by their context. The story moves quickly, interspersed by brief comments made by the fantasmas. At the center is the story of the adventures of the two sisters; a rich and engaging story, not to be missed.

Paris to London with fellow travelers on the Eurostar train.

This is a look at fascinating group of fellow citizens of this planet traveling back to London from Paris on the Eurostar train.

Firstly, a comment. The doors on the Eurostar train are not designed to be on the same level in height as the platform the train is stationed at. So, you have to lift yourself and your suitcase up onto the train to get on and then get yourself and your suitcase off the train on arrival-not easy. I can only presume that the original engineering types who designed the trains and the platforms forgot to meet and agree on the same heights. It would be so much easier if they had.

Secondly those who make the journey seem to fit into various categories so from the view of a person watcher it is interesting to fit them into some imagined slots. Especially so if you have got some time to spare before the train leaves. I paid the higher fare and travelled in Eurostar Premium so did not see how some of the travelers in the cheaper seats managed. Nevertheless, before boarding was allowed the whole group assembled waiting to be allowed to board and it was then possible to have a good look at all of the travelling personages. This is what I saw and then mentally imagined putting them into various groups.

The well-dressed techies. One of whom was seated just across from where I was sitting. He was a very well-dressed techie. He had obviously booked himself 2 seats so he could spread out. He had 2 laptops open, a cell phone and ear buds. All this was connected by various cables he produced from a small black purse. His luggage consisted only of a small very shiny metal suitcase and a black bag designed to hold laptops and assorted cables. He worked during the entire train trip using both laptops and probably took a taxi to the office when he arrived in London.
The other techies consisted of the not so well dressed. They had long hair, ponytails, glasses and beards of course. They mostly fiddled around with their phones or bought out laptops which had stickers on them. There were a number of Asian techies as well. They were generally well dressed and almost all of them went to sleep after getting on the train. Probably due to the fact that they had worked all the previous night on some project.

The smart set consisted of both men and women. They are all well dressed in designer clothes. Form fitting in black with some white accents. Usually carrying the absolute minimum amount of luggage. They know exactly where they are going. They don’t talk to anyone or even each other unless someone calls them on their cell phone which seemed to happen quite frequently.

The shoppers included several categories. The gays who went to Paris to see the latest collections. They couldn’t wait to buy the latest creation their friends had just made.
The food lovers-coming home with large paper bags with the names of the stores where they made their purchases. Lots of cakes, chocolates, jams and other exotic food creations. They probably should not have bought some of those things because they tended to be somewhat overweight. The chronic shopper types- probably spent just a few days in Paris but were coming home with a suitcase the size of a small closet. Where on the train that type of suitcase could possibly be stored is interesting to think about. I had problems in storing my own suitcase which was only about one third the size of the ones I saw.

The frazzled parents with small children equipped with strollers and large bags of baby stuff. The mothers are all universally frazzled. The husbands come in two varieties. The absolutely bored ones not interested in their children. You could see from their expressions that they were wishing they were home having a beer and watching a football game on TV. Then the really involved ones taking care of everything and driving their wives crazy by doing that. The traveling children who are all mostly under ten. They screeched at high levels and then suddenly ran off somewhere and then had to be pursued by one or other parent.

The older generation includes the retired school teacher and university professor types. Beards, glasses, and sensible non-iron clothes are their standard uniforms. They probably
Went over to Paris to study some obscure subject in science or history and then write a paper that less then twenty people will ever read. Their wives are also dressed in a similar fashion to their husbands. They are grey haired ladies with no make-up. They are serious minded, interested in gardening, sustainable agriculture and recycling.

The retired military/police/political/business types are dressed in clothes that can be up to 40 or 50 years old. They wear their hair short and some of the men have moustaches or well-trimmed beards. The suitcases they use are the ones they inherited from their parents or used when they went off to school many years ago. They have been to Paris many, many times for conferences and meetings and usually stay in the same hotel every time. Their wives, if they still have them, look the same as their husbands but without the beards and moustaches.

The younger generation backpack types. They are traveling the world on limited budgets and stay in youth hostels with shared rooms and bathrooms. They have enormous backpacks holding the types clothing to be used for their next adventure. Be it climbing mountains or jumping off cliffs with a parachute. I remember seeing one lady of this generation in the metro in Paris, she had an enormous backpack and with her she also had a dog and a bicycle. How she managed to climb the metro stairs with all that stuff is hard to imagine. Maybe the dog helped.

The hooligan type arrived late, unshaved with tousled hair and bloodshot eyes. Probably still hung over even at one o’clock in the afternoon. Generally speaking, these are young men under the age of 30. All they have had for breakfast is a can of beer. They are rabid fans of some football club traveling on some cheap promotional ticket. Fortunately, they are not included in Eurostar Premium seating.

I have categorized my fellow passengers as I saw them. It passes the time, and one can apply one’s imagination as to who they are and what they do.

Of all the places I have seen in my travels, I think the most interesting was Petra in Jordan and St. Catherine’s Monastery in the Sinai, which my son Tom and I visited in 1995. I had been fascinated since my youth with Petra, the “rose-red city half as old as time,” and was glad to be able to go.
We flew from London to Aqaba, Jordan, arriving at 3 a.m. and immediately embarking on a 2-hour bus trip to our hotel outside Petra. After a short nap, breakfast, and a briefing, we were taken to Little Petra (Bedouins living in caves and tents selling trinkets), the remnants of a Neolithic settlement at Beida, and the crusader castle of Showbak.
The next day we rode horses to the mouth of the Siq, the traditional entrance to Petra itself. It’s a very narrow, winding slot canyon between walls of sandstone so high the sun never reaches the canyon floor. The walk through the Siq was awesome and a bit eerie, and at the end we stepped suddenly into full sunlight to face The Treasury, or Khazneh, a huge temple carved into the golden-colored sandstone. If you have seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade you have seen that view. For me, it was a jaw-dropping, stop-in-your-tracks experience.
A World Heritage Site, Petra includes both Nabatean and Roman structures: scores of tombs carved into wildly colored sandstone formations, temples such as the Treasury, the Palace, and the Monastery (El Deir), the Roman amphitheater, and the Roman Colonnaded Street.
One morning, wisely nixing a strenuous hike to the “High Place,” I stayed on the valley floor. A beautiful, peaceful experience – cool early morning air, a quiet bustle of camel drivers and shopkeepers, and, blessedly, no tourists. I bought a little airline bottle full of multicolored Petra sand that I still treasure, and relaxed and drank in this exotic place.
On our way to Egypt we went to Wadi Rum, the actual site of Lawrence of Arabia’s exploits in WWI and of the Seven Pillars of Wisdom rock formation that inspired his book’s title.
Benefitting from recent treaties, we were one of the first groups to go from Jordan into Israel, via the famous Allenby Bridge, and then to Egypt (Israeli security made it an unpleasant experience). Our destination, St. Catherine’s Monastery, is the oldest active Christian monastery in the world. Its library contains the oldest Bible in the world, the Codex Sinaiticus. It is a Greek manuscript from the middle of the 4th century and the most famous of the manuscripts in the monastery’s library, which also has the world’s largest surviving collection of Byzantine bindings.
The monastery guards the Burning Bush –thriving in a corner of the courtyard – and its refectory walls are covered with graffiti carved by crusaders in the 12th Century, when the monastery was a safe haven and hospital for both sides. The trip to the monastery was through the driest, bleakest desert that Tom, who has been in a bunch of deserts, has ever seen
We ended our adventure on a ferry from Egypt back to Aqaba that was filled with white-clad pilgrims headed to Mecca. It was a great trip that I have treasured ever since.

Here is the transcribed text from the image:

**You, too, Pal.**

"Merry Christmas!" What? Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Same to you, buddy. Whatever. Like, happy, right?

The Dalai Lama claims happiness to be the sole purpose of life. But Aldous Huxley countered that "the pursuit of happiness is but the pursuit of distractions." Meanwhile, novelist Edith Wharton asserts that if you make up your mind to be unhappy, then you ought to have a pretty good time.

In other words, Edith, author of *The House of Mirth,* seems to believe it would be best, perhaps, to slow down our pursuits, to maybe stop chasing rainbows and their magic terrariums of bliss. Because, let’s face it, one who expects nothing is rarely disappointed. (Just ask anybody here at the Heritage if that isn’t so.)

So, okay, buddy, yeah, Merry Christmas to you, too, whoever you are.

The Heritage Oak
By Margaret Missiaen

The large tree with gray bark in the parking lot is a coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia). As the unofficial Heritage tree hugger, I am asked to identify nearby trees. I wrote about the London plane trees on Francisco in the August 2023 issue of the Happenings. However, this oak was more of a challenge because there are dozens of oak species and I am more familiar with the deciduous oaks of the East. A few weeks ago, I noticed acorns lying on the ground. As any good arborist knows, once you have an acorn, identification is easy. (With a little help from Google images.)
The coast live oak is a drought-resistant evergreen that can grow to 80 feet. Native mostly to the coast side of California's Coast Range, and along streams draining into the Central Valley. The range runs from Mendocino County in the north to Mexico's Baja California. The bark of young trees is smooth but with age, the thick bark develops deep furrows and ridges. The acorn is brown, narrowly egg-shaped, 1-2 inches long, with a thin cap.

Martin Nolan: Mightier Than the Sword

Not many of us can add the following to our list of achievements:

- Interviewed 12 US presidents
- Been on Nixon’s Enemy List
- Won a Pulitzer
- Met with Yasser Arafat
- Coined the phrase “Joe Six-Pack”

But your pal Marty Nolan can.

Nolan rose to prominence as a reporter and Washington DC Bureau Chief for The Boston Globe. His career spanned four tumultuous decades when political stakes often intersected with the soul of our nation.

Marty’s philosophy on writing was to "poke" people, and he did that with aplomb.

For those who’ve read or followed his work, you know he reported not just to inform, but to illuminate. He didn’t view history as a static retelling of events but as a vibrant narrative shaped by human ambition, folly, and resilience. Or as one might call it, the political 3-act play (since the dawn of man).

Whether profiling political titans or dissecting the machine of Washington, his pen wielded equal parts empathy and skepticism.

In Boys on the Bus, a 1973 book on campaign journalism, the author, Timothy Crouse, described Martin, then in his mid-30s, as:

"A witty man… with the unshaven, slack-jawed, nuts-to-you-too look of a bartender in a sailors’ cafe.”

But Marty had more than wit, he was a compassionate American with deep respect for democratic ideals and those who pursued them.

It may come as no surprise that following Marty’s storied career, the Oral History Center of The Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley approached him for a book of interviews about his life. Fortunately for all of us, that book was recently published and it’s available in our very own Stucky Library. Do yourself a favor and give Marty’s fascinating life a read.

Washington Bureau Chief, Editorial Page Editor, 1961–2001, conducted by Lisa Rubens in 2023.

As we look ahead to 2025, there are several exciting initiatives we’re continuing to work on, including:

· Moving forward with our Land Use Permit process, which we hope to secure by the end of the first quarter.

· Celebrating the 100-Year Anniversary of the Julia Morgan building on March 25, 2025.

· Pursuing Landmark Designation for the Julia Morgan building, with the hope of achieving this by the first quarter of 2025.

· Collaborating with the Board of Directors in the process of exploring a potential affiliation.

I’m also excited about the continued growth of our Aging in Place program, which currently supports at least 11 residents, allowing them to remain in their independent living homes. We’ve made great strides in building our team and are proud to be fully staffed for the first time in at least four years. While we continue to use registry staff for sick and vacation leaves, all our full-time positions are currently filled. As we continue to improve our operations, we are introducing a Maintenance Tech position to enhance maintenance coverage during evenings and weekends, as well as a Ward Clerk position at Henderson Clinic to ensure timely phone support in the evenings. We are also implementing 24/7 Security to enhance the safety of our Residents, Team Members, and the broader Community.

There are new regulations coming into effect on January 1, 2025, which will allow for the care of individuals with dementia in their apartments, without requiring them to move to a higher level of care. Thanks to our Aging in Place model, we are already well-positioned to meet these changes, and we are proud to be leaders in this area. I’m also working alongside a dedicated team at the state level through LeadingAge California, as part of the Assisted Living Cabinet. We are collaborating with the Department of Social Services (DSS) to help refine these regulations to better support communities like ours, which are staffed with healthcare providers around the clock. Our goal is to shape the future of "enhanced assisted living," allowing us to offer more comprehensive care within the Aging in Place framework.

Above all, I’m excited to continue fostering a community that is both healthy and compassionate, where every team member is committed to serving each other and our Residents. We are incredibly fortunate to have such a caring and dedicated staff across all departments, and I am deeply grateful for each of them.
