# 2025-05-29 A Message from Your Heritage Happenings Editor

* Keeping Our Community Connected in Changing Times

## Dear Neighbors and Friends,

As we've all witnessed throughout our lives, the world continues to change around us. From the days when news came by radio, to television, and now to computers and smartphones, each generation has found new ways to stay connected and informed.

Today, I'm writing to share some thoughts about the future of our beloved Heritage Happenings newsletter, and to ask for your patience and input as we navigate this together.

I want you to know that I deeply respect and share your appreciation for the printed word. There's something special about holding a newsletter in your hands, reading it with your morning coffee, or sharing it with a neighbor. I estimate that most of you, our Heritage on the Marina residents, still prefer reading the news on paper - and that preference is completely understandable and valid.

## Looking Back: Four Years of Dedication

Over the past four years, I've been committed to bringing you Heritage Happenings in print, just as many of you prefer. However, this process has become increasingly challenging:

* Preparing each printed edition requires significant time and resources
* Despite my requests, additional support from our management has not been available
* To maintain quality, I've been investing my own funds to hire my niece for editorial assistance

I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve our community this way, but I believe it's time to explore options that will help us sustain and improve our newsletter for years to come.

## Present

* Now I feel it's time for a change
* I am changing the priority to digital or on the web first
* It should still be possible to print posts for those who want them
* Will be available online as a blog post at https://heritage-happenings.github.io
* By email and PDF
* Maybe even by WhatsApp, as an audiobook

## Future

* There will be problems. 
* I want to to do the writing and the graphic design. 
* I don't want to be the one doing the printing and distributing.
* Feel free to contact me with any questions, comments, or suggestions. To help
