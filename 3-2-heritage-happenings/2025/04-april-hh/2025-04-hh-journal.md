## Trish and Mia

Here's what I have so far for the April Issue

## Editorial Committee Meeting

4pm March 20 in the McGinley room (unless anybody wants to do lunch)


## Country of the Month

The country of the month is Hawaii. Well, it was a country.

## Health topic

The Health topic is: 4. April ~ Healthy Relationships (with Yourself & Others)

Mia Did you put any writing together when you were researching about what this topic does and does not cover?

Some ideas:

* When somebody offers to help: learn to yes now. Get prepared to be old and teach the others how that can help you.
* Share "your people". Many people here have few if any outside connections
* Try to remember people's names

Also: please share the links to your sources. The will end up on the Heritage Happenings web site eventually

## Centenary Celebration

This should be a block buster article 

* Landmark Plaque: image + text ~ text: by me ~ cost: my donation
* Dignitaries: images + quotes
* Proclamations: images
* Celebration: images
* What else could there be?
