# Healthy Relationships

When I think of the seventy five residents at Heritage on the Marina, I think of the many relationships we have with each other. Some are close friends, some are acquaintances, and some are people we see in passing. Each relationship is unique and special in its own way. We should grateful for the connections we have made here and the support we provide each other.

On the whole we residents have very healthy relationships with each other.

But what about our relations ships with others?

## Relations with Henderson Clinic sta

On the whole,Relationships with fwith team members is friendly anf cordial. If there is one aspect that could use work, it is that residents sometimes do not understand that Henderson Clinic staff have different roles and responsibilities. The are registered nurses (RN), licensed vocational nurses (LVN), and certified nursing assistants (CNA). Each of these roles has different training and responsibilities. For example, a CNA is not allowed to administer medications. A RN is responsible for the overall care of the patient and is the only one who can make medical decisions. Some are full time some are part time and some are agency staff. It is not easy to keep track of who is who and who is able to do what. This can be especially tricky for new residents, residents who have have cognitive issues and particularly for friends and family members who are not familiar with the staff.

Learn the differences yourself and be able to explain them to others. This will help you and your family understand the roles of the staff and what they can do for you.

This is particulaly true when you have been ill and family are coming in to visit. They may not understand the roles of the staff and may be confused when they see a staff member doing something that they think should be done by a nurse. This can lead to misunderstandings and frustration for both the family and the staff.

Relations with family and friends outside of Heritage

I try hard to hve my daughters and friemnds meet and get to know residents and staff. Fingers crossed that when it comes time for my celebration of life that all you will attend and be able to share stories about me. But closer at hand, as and when the issues oaging take their toll, that my family will will be able to use residents as a resource and support system.

Relations with the our neighbors in the Marina
We seem to have so much fun here that we hardly get to know any of our neighbors. I find this interesting as when I walk around the neighborhood I se so many people in out age group that look like nice people. I am slowly building up connections with Next Village an organozation that helps old people age in place. They have resources we don;t have and vice versa.
