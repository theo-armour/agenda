# 2025-01-19 Calling All Sleepyheads

Dear Residents,

Those of you who read January Heritage Happenings may have seen our piece on the twelve monthly health topics, unfolding throughout 2025.

You may recall (or not) that ***Sleep*** is our featured topic for February. This is where all you dreamers (and insomniacs) come in...

Please send me a short testimonial about your sleep — a pattern, ritual, or sleep aid (meditation, exercise, effective supplement or drug) — or tell us why you struggle to sleep, so others feel less alone, tossing and turning 'til dawn.

As the full article will be a concise 1-2 pages, your testimonial should ideally be one or two sentences. Feel free to email me or send your carrier pigeon to my room.

If we're not able to feature you in Feb due to limited space, we'll tap you for a testimonial in March, April, or later in the year.

Merci, sleepers!

Theo
