# To China in 1978

In the fall of 1978, I was invited along with a group of fellow members of the Royal Institute of British Architects to a study tour of the Peoples Republic of China. The Brits had re-established relations far earlier than the US.

To China

Seeing this "To China" photo still gives me the shivers. The ensuing visit was the culmination of long-held ambition and the inspiration for a life-long engagement with the country.

Steam train

The train trip to Guangdong was eye opening. I had never seen a working steam locomotive. Every seat in our car had lace antimacassars. I saw oxen pulling plows in the rice paddies. It was like stepping back into the 19th century.

In Canton our hotel kitchen was not as basic as this one in a commune. Nonetheless at one of our first meals, I asked the waiter for a clean glass because mine was covered in dried out gray colored water drops. He looked at it closely and told me he thought it looked clean enough. It dawned on me that the waiter had never seen a glass that was not washed by hand. He had no idea what a clean glass looked like.

In Fosan, we visited a several "factories" where workers were making timelessly beautiful things by hand. Why buy an antique when you can buy a new one that is even better?


The factories appeared to be just as old. This worker is operating a steam engine used to power a metal press in a car factory

People were fascinated by us, shy but friendly. At one point my friend Chris and I started waling down a line of elementary school of youngsters in a park. As we got around the corner, we say like 500 more kids. We shook hands with all of them.


The canals in Suzhou reminded me of Venice. Or what they must have been liked a long time ago.

But the Garden of the Humble Administrator was not at all humble.

In Shanghai we stayed in the hotel Nixon stayed in, built by Russians. The hotel was a time capsule of the 1950s. The chef invited us for a special tasting event. He asked us to taste three different glasses of a brown liquid and tell him which tasted the most like Coca-Cola.

Near the first office of the Chinese Communist party, we saw people definitely not plotting the next revolution.


The Forbidden City is such a display of power, design and planning. It makes the Whites House look like a cottage.

The Summer Palace was a shock and awe moment for peasants, workers and me too.

The Great Wall was a great walk. Built to keep out my Mongolian ancestors. But there I was, walking on it.

The interesting reflection on this first trip is that I cannot remember a single indication that just a few years later that China would be the world's factory. I remember thinking that the Chinese were so far behind the rest of the world that they would never catch up. I was wrong.
