<h3 id="issue">Issue</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I can get overlapping audio if I start an audio of a story, go back to the original email and select the link again, select a different story and start its audio.  I doubt you could fix that easily, but if a resident got into that situation, it might not be evident how to get out of it except by waiting for every audio to end.</p>

<h3 id="theo-2025-07-24-can-improve">Theo 2025-07-24: Can improve</h3>
<p>Quick solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Val's observation: At any time, stop Read Aloud by clicking on the speaker icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems</p>
<ul>
<li>Val's observation: Nobody told you (or reminded you) about the turn-off feature.</li>
<li>Developer had not identified the issue</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the Read Aloud icon so that it indicates start and stop visually</li>
<li>When you click on a new story, automatically stop Read Aloud in the current story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Status</p>
<ul>
<li>Both solutions look like being moderately easy to Incorporate in the next release or two.</li>
</ul>

<p>Val:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am testing on my iPhone. When it comes up initially I only see part of the word STORIES, and not the speaker symbol, nor the font size controls. Swiping left does not help, turning my phone horizontally does not help, squeezing together does reduce the font size, so I can see everything.</p>

<h3 id="theo-2025-07-24-reply">Theo 2025-07-24: Reply</h3>
<p>I experienced the same and similar issues.</p>
<p>IMHO, there is no simple solution, but there is a &quot;beautiful&quot; solution: Distinguish between and design for at least three sizes and types of devices</p>
<ul>
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Tablet</li>
<li>Phone</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, given that the current set of target users will uses tablets or iPads: please test and comment only on tablet or iPads issues. Phone issues wil be explored in a future product at a later date</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I also found this site very sensitive to the touch on the screen. It kept jumping around between articles up and down and all around. I found it very disconcerting Nancy.</p>

<p>Nancy: This is precisely the kind of feedback I need. Thank you</p>
<p>I feel that this issues indicates that the zooming and the swiping touches are being called in ways not friendly to hands with varying amounts of motion control abilities.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<ul>
<li>Next step: disable two-finger zoom and see if this helps reduce jiggling</li>
</ul>
