Hi Tess, Val and Tom

>>The links work, but they might stand out more if they were a different color than the titles.

Can do. The template has been updated

>> And can they have alternate text rather than the “http etc”.

This presents an interesting dilemma.

You can have two different kinds of PDF files.

1. PDF files intended to be viewed on a computer.
2. PDF files intended to be viewed on paper.

With case 1. a link that says

"Wikipedia: Salem NJ" could take your browser to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_New_Jersey

With case 2.

You get a piece of text that does nothing: "Wikipedia: Salem NJ"

So, if we decide to print for people using paper, then we should keep naked links so people could actually type it in if they ever got to a computer.

With Val, I have been discussing font sizes. And I have continued exploring ways printing web pages in different ways.

I hope to send out some new improved examples in the next few days.

Cheers,

Theo
