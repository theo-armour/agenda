# 2025-07-20 Beta Testers

Hello "Beta testers"

[Heritage Happenings Mobile App]( https://heritage-happenings.github.io/momo )

A beta tester is a real user who tries out a new product, usually software or an app, before it is officially released to the public. The goal is to use it in real-life situations, find any bugs or usability problems, and give honest feedback to the developers so they can fix issues and make improvements before the full launch.

You are invited to be a beta tester of a new _Heritage Happenings_ app. Click the link up above.

Once the app opens, scroll down below the July cover picture to see how to use the site.

Tess, Val and Tom: This release includes a number of new features: swiping, zooming and read-aloud.

Nancy and Trish: I am inviting you to have a look because I know you have good experience in coping with various vision abilities.

The objective of this project is to help residents with with tremor, vision and memory issues to stay engaged with our life here.

It's not about us now. It's about paying forward to the people we might be in the future.

As and when you reply, please "reply all". I look forward to your observations and suggestions.

Cheers,

Theo
