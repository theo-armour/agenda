Hi Tess, Val and Tom

Please have a look at:

https://heritage-happenings.github.io/

The mobile version of the Heritage Happenings has had a number of revisions, including:

* When text size changes, body text positions adjusts more appropriately
* Text Size buttons: middle reset button deleted
* Text Size buttons: better at staying together
* All July emails now included
* Read Me updated
* URLs greatly simplified
* Zooming with two fingers turned off
* Scrolling options simplified
* And a number of other minor edits

I look forward to hearing your comments. If you have a comment, please do reply all.

Cheers,

Theo
