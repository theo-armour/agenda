* An Email
* In the Heritage Happenings app we are building
* Printed on paper via a PDF file
* A file of archivable quality

* Remove all the artifacts embedded a Microsoft Word file.

5. App: the result you see when the HTML is viewed on the mobile app we are building
6. Audio: what you hear when you click on "Read Aloud"
