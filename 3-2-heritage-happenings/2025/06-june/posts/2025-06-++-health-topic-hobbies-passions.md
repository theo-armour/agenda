# A Hobby a Day Keeps the Gloom Away

Right out of the gate, some heartening news: A 2023 study from University College London says hobbies aren't just a way to pass the time — they’re downright medicinal.

Researchers looked at over 93,000 people ages 65 and up (yes, they counted us in!) across 16 countries. It probably won’t surprise you that folks with hobbies reported feeling more satisfied, less blue, and generally more alive. It turns out that adding that tiny mast to your model boat or knitting a lopsided scarf is excellent for your brain.

Dr Karen Mak, one of the researchers, says hobbies do double duty: they give us a sense of purpose and help us feel more competent. Not a bad deal.

And here’s the best part, you don’t have to be good at it. Joy, Dr Mak reminds us, does not require talent. So if your bridge skills peaked during the Reagan administration, that’s just fine. You show up and (hopefully) have fun.

So go ahead, channel your inner Picasso, smack those Mahjong tiles, or join the neighborhood walking group, even if you roll instead of stroll.

Whether it actually lifts your mood — or it's just a placebo effect from reading this article — it’s a win.

At the very least, you’ll have an entertaining story to share with us at dinner.
