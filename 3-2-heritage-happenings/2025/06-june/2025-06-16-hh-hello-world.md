# Heritage Happenings ~ Hello World

Hello Heritage Happenings Beta Testers

This is the first message using the new Heritage Happenings Gmail address. "Hello, World!" is the first message techies typically send out on a new system.

The purpose of this email address is to enable multiple residents to send emails and share documents using a single password.

You will be able to remember the password easily. It is the same password that you use to get into Heritage Resident Wi-Fi.

A second aspect of this message: you may note that there is a file attached to this message. The file contains the text of this message. The idea is that residents will print the articles and posts for easier reading or that the Front Office could print posts and distribute them to the residents without devices.

Cheers,

Theo
