# First Look

Hello Jennifer, Patrick, Tom & Val

Kindly have a look at this link:

Heritage Happenings Website
https://heritage-happenings.github.io/#Blog/2025-06-09-Heritage-Happenings-Website-Soft-Opening.md

The link takes you to a beta-test version of the website I intend to use as the basis for transforming the _Heritage Happenings_ from a paper-first publication to a web-first medium.

The post should help you understand the kind of feedback that might be helpful at this stage. 

And, not to forget, it's all just for the fun of it, so anything goes. All ideas and inspirations welcomed.

Cheers,

Theo
