# Time to Move


Hippocrates in Ancient Greece observed "Eating alone will not keep a man well; he must also take exercise. For food and exercise, while possessing opposite qualities, yet work together to produce health."

Seventy years ago in England, The National Health ago studied London bus conductors  London bus drivers who live in the same environment. The only difference: the bus drivers were sitting, the conductors were standing. The heart disease rate among the drivers was twice that of the conductors.

The modern breakthrough is that researchers now gathering actual proof of the benefits of exercise, down at a molecular level.

Euan Ashley, is professor of cardiovascular medicine and genetics at Stanford University. He is the newly named chair of its Department of Medicine. Dr Ashley is an expert. He discussed the benefits of exercise in a recentPBS interview.


The first study was rats that were sedentary, and then they were trained over the course of eight weeks aerobic training on a treadmill.

we were really surprised to find was that they turned into almost different—exercise was that potent. Every single tissue we looked at showed something completely different from before. It really changed the entire molecular makeup of the individual organs of the rats in a very positive direction.

Exercise is just such a remarkable intervention, essentially helping with, for example, reducing the risk of heart disease by 50 percent, reducing the risk of many cancers by 50 percent and more, reducing the risk of back pain.

People sleep better. They have better mood. They're able to breathe better. There are just so many ways in which exercise helps.

Any movement is better than none. So, if you're in a sedentary job or you're not used to moving much, then just stand up. Standing up is a good start.

If you can walk, take some walking paces, go for a walk at lunchtime. If you can get 30 to 45 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, like a brisk walk, if you can do that five, six times a week, that's fantastic.

One of the things I regularly tell my patients — is that one minute of exercise buys you five minutes of extra life, which means you definitely have time to exercise.

So you definitely have time to make in your day to exercise. It doesn't matter whether you do it in the morning, at lunchtime, in the evenings. It's particularly good after meals, so the evening is a fine time to take a brisk walk.

But the main thing is get up, move about as much as you can.
