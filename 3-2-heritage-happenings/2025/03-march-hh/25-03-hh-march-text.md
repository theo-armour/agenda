### Title??

By Tucker Ingham

The expression "a stream of consciousness" is Irish, and made known by its creator, James Joyce,  through his two books, *Ulysses* and *Finnegans Wake* . Both books explore Irish culture in the early 20th century, though they were written by Joyce in Paris over twenty years after he left Ireland, never to return. Joyce brought his recent girlfriend with him, whom he refused to marry while they raised two daughters in penury, drifting around Europe while teaching school and writing short articles from 1904 to 1920, when persuaded by Ezra Pound to move to Paris along with Ernest Hemingway, F Scott Fitzgerald, and other notable authors.

Sylvia Beach in 1922, proprietor of the Left Bank Shakespeare and Company bookstore, risked publishing Ulysses and lost her investment as the book failed to succeed on the market. Its language was contrived and cryptic. Its message unintelligible. A judge called upon the censor, declared it obscure and emetic, but not prurient. Perhaps because of its public failure, many copies were burned by postal authorities, as undeliverable.

By 1933, Joyce was almost blind, but still determined to make his mark as an intellectual author. By 1941, he'd finished *Finnegans Wake* (no apostrophe purposely), where he took obscurity to an extreme. People assuming that its baffling style indicated secret knowledge. 260 pounds of his notes produced 628 pages of a book. "More noted than read and when read, only partly and rarely understood by anyone ... notoriously the most obscure book ever written by a major writer, at least one who was not known to be out of his mind." -: Daniel Boorstin, *The Creators*, Chapter 68
