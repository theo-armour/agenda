* Set to move with text
* Set Layout Options to "With Text Wrapping" > Square and "Move with text"
* An image 1.3 inches wide is tiny. Crop incoming image heavily so that only the head of the presenter is visible then resize to 1.3 inches wide.

Special events text position

* Paragraph > Indentation: Left 1.5 inches


## File Naming

File names should be descriptive and include the date of the publication. For example, `2024-07-29-Heritage-Happenings.docx`.
* Generally, I prefer naming files so that they are ready for the web, hyphens as word separators, and for to sort by date in a folder. For example, `2024-07-29-heritage-happenings.md`.

## Residents

* In letter salutations, the first and all important words are typically capitalized as a matter of convention and respect.
* "Residents" is being used as a form of address (like "Dear Students," "Dear Colleagues," or "Dear Parents"), not as a generic noun in the body of the letter.
* In the body of the letter, you should not capitalize "residents" unless it is the first word of a sentence or part of a proper noun or official title.

## Tips

You can open Microsoft Word files on the web and also by using the Word desktop app. Unfortunately, files can display and print differently depending on the version. Currently, _Heritage Happenings_ files are edited using the desktop version. Use the desktop version otherwise you may screw up the format.

When you see text written in Latin starting with the words "Lorem ipsum", the text is a placeholder for text that will be replaced with the final text in the publication.

When you are working in a table, tabs have a special behavior. If you want to move to the next cell, use the Tab key. If you want to insert a tab character in the current cell, use Control or Command Tab.

Tabs in Calendar cells are used throughout the publication. Please do not use spaces in order to line up with tabbed items unless you have to,

Be very careful about copying text submitted by others. Most people are quite cavalier about the fonts they use and create documents with multiple random fonts. Use the Word feature to "Keep text only" or select the text and click "click all formatting".


Remember to search for and replace double spaces with single spaces.
