# Notes

???

Hi Ashley, this is Theo, Jim's friend. He mentioned you're going through a rough patch and asked if I could reach out. I remember meeting you at Green's restaurant when you were with Green Peace. I was very impressed by your dynamism and commitment.

  

I'm sorry to hear you're having a hard time. I'm here if you need an understanding ear or someone to lend some encouragement. In the meantime, be kind to yourself as you navigate the changes. Wishing you all the best! Theo

  

What are two topics you might discuss? General topics such as last night's game or a favorite TV show are fine.

What is one thing you hope to say?

What is one question you will ask?
