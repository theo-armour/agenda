What do you do for a living?

How has your education or professional experiences influenced your perspective on life?
My first career was as an architect. I was educated in London at the architectural association And then went on to live in Hong Kong and design 12 subway stations Period. During that process, I came to realize that the future of architecture would depend on computer aided design. I switched career and became a dealer of oracade software. Eventually I was hired by Autodesk as a consultant, and I was sent around Asia to teach people how to use Autocad to design things. Eventually. The company invited me to come and work with them in Marin County, San Francisco, outside of San Francisco. And I helped design three releases of Oracle. Subsequently, I have designed websites and built many three dimensional interactive demos in the browser.

How did you choose this career?
My first career as an architect was chosen by my stepmother. As a child, I drew a lot. And she suggested that I should become an architect when I grow up. After that, I made my own career choices based on what I thought was interesting and fun.
