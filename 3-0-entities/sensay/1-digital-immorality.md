## What Color is Your ~~Parachute~~ Immortality?

## Introduction

I am no psychologist, but I guess would understand the idea that people have multiple facets or sides to their personalities, endeavors and dreams. Many of these aspects have elements that might be logged and are replicable. These might include Big 5 personality traits, political compass,social network activity and other psychological and anthropological aspects of a person.

Another way lens (hermeneutic) for building a replica might be aspects of something like film or book genres, are there aspects of a film noir, or sitcom or a romance that could be used to build a replica of a person.

A third lens might be more like a tone or a color, are there aspects of a person that are more like a color or a tone that could be used to build a replica of a person. These easpects might be derived from aspects such as faovrite songs, book they like, or the way they dress.

In the long term all of these aspects become useful and prodyctive in building an authentic and useful replica of a person.

But what about in the short term right here in the middle of 2024?

My guess is that some of the following topics could be used to create the basis of a fun way of entering data in the system that also helps you gain a badge or earn game points.

I could see some of the items being to create multiple choice quizzes


## Assumptions

At no time does Sensay ask for data that Sensay cannot keep and protect up to the level of the source of the data.. In other words any medical data should be protect up to HIPPAA, GDPR, PIPL standards. Any Banking data should be up to PCI DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, SWIFT CSP standards. So it take a while before Sensay can accept data from such sources. We must be careful about asking for such data until we can protect it from access by naughty people

You should be able to download your data and be able to delete your data at any time.
