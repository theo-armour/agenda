## What Color is Your ~~Parachute~~ Immortality?

## Introduction

There is you and then there is a replica of you.

* In the 1980s I help China learn how to used computers to design products and factories
* In the 1990s I help architects and engineers transition from paper to CAD
* In the 2010s I help the Web get going on interactive 3D in the browser

in the 2020, my mission is to help you live or your replica forever.

;-)


## What is a replica?

What are some of the many possible replicas?


## First Replica: Eternal self-replicating immortal replicas

You are what yoy were.

You are a replica. You a compilation of Cellular organisms There have been replicating themselves for over 4 billion years.

* Your DNA is a close replica of the DNA that came into being over four billion years ago
* The same is true for the processes that cause DNA to build viruses, bacteria and multi-celled creatures.

### Ship of Theseus

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus

The Ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus's Paradox, is a thought experiment and paradox about whether an object is the same object after having had all of its original components replaced over time, typically one after the other.

In essence every living thing is a "Ship of Theseus" an almost exact replica of its predecessor a close replicas to the things of billions of years ago.

In essence you are older than any mountain or geological feature on the face of this earth

### Last universal common ancestor

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_common_ancestor

The last universal common ancestor (LUCA) is the hypothesized common ancestral cell from which the three domains of life, the Bacteria, the Archaea, and the Eukarya originated. It is suggested to have been a "cellular organism that had a lipid bilayer and used DNA, RNA, and protein".[2] The LUCA has also been defined as "a hypothetical organism ancestral to all three domains".[3] The LUCA is the point or stage at which the three domains of life diverged from preexisting forms of life (about 3.5–3.8 billion years ago). The nature of this point or stage of divergence remains a topic of research.

Following link goes to a summary

### What percentage of my DNA is the same as another persons?

* All humans share approximately 99.9% of their DNA with each other. This means that the genetic differences between any two individuals are contained within the remaining 0.1% of their DNA. This small portion accounts for the variations that make each person unique.

### What percentage of DNA do humans share with snakes?

* Humans share approximately 60% of their DNA with snakes. This percentage reflects the genetic similarities that exist due to shared evolutionary ancestry, despite the significant differences in physiology and biology between humans and reptiles

### What percentage of the DNA does a human today share with A creature of 4 billion years ago?

Humans today share a surprisingly high percentage of their DNA with ancient life forms, even those from billions of years ago. While exact percentages are difficult to pinpoint due to the vast evolutionary distances and the lack of direct DNA samples from such ancient organisms, it is estimated that humans share a significant portion of their genetic material with all life forms due to common ancestry.

1. **Common Ancestry and Shared DNA**: All life on Earth shares a common ancestor, and this is reflected in the genetic material. For instance, humans share about 60% of their DNA with fruit flies and about 40% with plants[1][2]. This indicates that fundamental biological processes and structures are conserved across vastly different species.

2. **Evolutionary Conservation**: The genetic similarities between humans and ancient life forms are due to the conservation of essential genes that are crucial for basic cellular functions. These genes have been preserved throughout billions of years of evolution because they are fundamental to life.

3. **Estimations**: While specific percentages for DNA shared with a creature from 4 billion years ago are not available, it is clear that a substantial portion of our DNA would be similar due to the shared basic biochemical and cellular processes that have been conserved over time[2][4].

In summary, humans share a significant portion of their DNA with all life forms due to common ancestry and the conservation of essential genetic material over billions of years.
