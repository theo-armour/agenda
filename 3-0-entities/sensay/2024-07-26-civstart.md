Imagine that you are the mayor of a small town. You have are approached by a voter who is Burmese and does not speak English well. The votor is asking for help with a problem. What do you do?

Using Google Translate helps, but it fails frequently when translating idioms and colloquialisms let alone c omplex political issues from one culture to another. You could ask for help from a Burmese-speaking friend or family member, but that is not always possible. You could hire a translator, but that is expensive and time-consuming.

Now imagine that you invoke your replica and have your replica respond to the voter's issues in Burmese in real-time with no translator in the middle and responding with all your wisdom and local knowledge. That is the power of Sensay.
