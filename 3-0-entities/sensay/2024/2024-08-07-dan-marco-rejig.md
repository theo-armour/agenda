## My eyes are bigger than my stomach

I want to explain that as much as I adore the project and the people, I have too much to cope with in my life to be able to contribute as much as I would like to. I have to cut back on my commitments. I have to be more realistic about what I can do. I have to be more honest with myself and with you. Here is my draft. I would appreciate your feedback.

Dear Dan and Marco,

I really do not want to write and send this message. But it must be done.

I have bitten off more than I can chew.

The dream of working with an organization that Sensay is—has been my dream for decades.

When you presented the opportunity and evidence I jumped right in

Um, What I did not take into account in the jump is that I'm in the middle of a fulfilling, complex and enthralling life.

Thus, if I want to do something new I must stop doing something old.

Guess what? This is not easy. I have filled up with my life with things that I really like doing and I'm good at doing them and people trust me to continue the efforts I have started.

I do not want to do this but I must reconsider my commitment to Sensay.

I must:

* Not make promises I cannot keep
* Not say "Yes, I can do that"
* Not under deliver

Nonetheless, I do not want to stop contributing. But I must do this as and when I am inspired. Have a few moments to spare. Probably late in the evening when I have a glass of wine in my hand.

* Work on building my replica
* Draft the occasional blog post.
* Respond to Sensay posts on social media

Please note that my current primary project Is digitizing and archiving centuries of family history now in file boxes in a storage unit. In essence this is part of creating a digital replica of my family. So, fingers crossed, useful to the Sensay project.

I hope you understand. I hope you can forgive me.

Dear Dan and Marco,

Um, What I did not take into account in the jump is that I'm in the middle of a fulfilling, complex and enthralling life. Therefore, if I want to do something new I must stop doing something old, but I have not been able to do that.

Given these circumstances, I need to adjust my level of involvement with Sensay. To be clear:

* I remain committed to the project's vision and want to continue contributing.
* I must scale back my active involvement to ensure I don't overpromise or underdeliver.
* My contributions will be more sporadic and inspiration-driven rather than on a fixed schedule.

Moving forward, here's what I can realistically commit to:

Continuing work on building my personal replica
Drafting occasional blog posts when time and inspiration align
Engaging with Sensay's social media presence as time allows

Please note that my current primary project Is digitizing and archiving centuries of family history now in file boxes in a storage unit. In essence this is part of creating a digital replica of my family. So, fingers crossed,will be useful to the Sensay project.

Thank you for your understanding. I look forward to continuing our collaboration, albeit in an adjusted capacity.
