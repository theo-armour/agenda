## 1 ~ My eyes are bigger than my stomach

Dear Dan and Marco,

I really do not want to write and send this message. But it must be done.

I have bitten off more than I can chew. .

The dream of working with an organization that Sensay isâ€”has been my dream for decades.

When you presented the opportunity and evidence I jumped right in

Um, What I did not take into account in the jump is that I'm in the middle of a fulfilling, complex and enthralling life.

Thus, if I want to do something new I must stop doing something old.

Guess what? This is not easy. I have filled up with my life with things that I really like doing and I'm good at doing them and people trust me. To continue the efforts I have started.

I do not want to do this but I must reconsider my commitment to Sensay.

I must:

* Not make promises I cannot keep
* Not say "Yes, I can do that"
* Not under deliver

Nonetheless, I do not want to stop contributing. But I must do this as and when I am inspired. Have a few moments to spare. Probably late in the evening when I have a glass of wine in my hand.

* Work on building my replica
* Draft the occasional blog post.
* Respond to Tell me the big table today. Yes, we are. Ohh good. Yeah. Room for Sheila now, I think so. Yeah. Otherwise it's gonna be too many boys, probably. And they would all get upset. So she, she really could be an honorary boy today. I'll send her an email and tell him to be there. Okay. Right. You probably forget. Yeah, right September Literally. Tell tell Nothing September Start again OK Sensay posts on social media

Please note that my current primary project Is digitizing and archiving centuries of family history now in file boxes in a storage unit. In essence this is part of creating a digital replica of my family. So, fingers crossed, useful to the Sensay project.

I hope you understand. I hope you can forgive me.
