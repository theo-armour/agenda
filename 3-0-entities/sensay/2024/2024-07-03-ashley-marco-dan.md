## Here I am

Hello Ashley, Marco, and Dan,

I sent you the July issue of the Heritage Happenings, a publication I produce for the residents of a retirement community, my home, here in San Francisco. The average age of the community is over ninety-one. I am one of the babies. Thus I am surrounded by examples to learn from of people aging in different ways. I sent you the issue for two reasons.

1. Virtually every aspect of such an issue is a "replicette" of some aspect of a person's life. As a data-driven "solutionist", I revel in enabling processes of  gathering memories and observations.

2. For the last ten days of any given month, my brain begins to be taken over by the processes of preparing the monthly issue by, for example: Reminding people to finish their writing. Preparing the layout. Taking photos & making drawings. Proofreading. Copious editing. The process is almost as good as writing software in terms of making my entire brain feel alive, productive and useful.

Now that the July issue is out, I can come back down to earth. I write this to let you know that I feel both of these aspects will help me be a useful contributor to the Sensay project by helping making it a forever project and a virtuous journey.

I am currently drafting more messages - double-clicking on various topics. So no need to reply to this message.




## March

Onboarding me

Please see my previous message "Here I am".

In June I had to give up on diving into all the Sensay channels of communication. I am delighted, however, by the richness, complexity and sharing of thoughts that I see in the Sensay community. I am looking forward to being a part of it.

I was able, however, to get started on some of the devops aspects in my primary development environment.

* WSL2 is installed
* Node.js is installed
* Windows Sandbox is installed

Now I would like to spend a few days exploring telegram, discord and any other channels I find.

So what about scheduling my onboarding for sometime next week?
