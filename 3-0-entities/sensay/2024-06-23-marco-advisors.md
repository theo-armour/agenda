Hi Marco

I hope North Macedonia is treating you well.

Thank you for your good introduction in the Advisory Board meeting. You picked up on some key points of my personality: I'm happiest when I can be enthusiastic and when using my brain as much as possible.

The Sensay Advisors all sound like interesting people. I look forward to interacting with you, them and your team.

I hope my background will be useful. Things that come to mind: When I was in Hong Kong I dealt with thousands of users - individually of on stage. At Autodesk, I was the product designer and user experience person working with two hundred or so engineering, tech pubs and QA people - mostly by first name. And for the last few years, I have been coding almost every day: using JavaScript and Three.js for thinking with linear algebra, 3D interaction in order to build demos from users verbal prompts. So voice-to-3D-interaction - and I am the bot. ;-)

I have started updating my LinkedIn profile:: https://www.linkedin.com/in/theoa/

I have much, more to add to my profile. I will be adding more - and adding links to some of my projects.

While this us going, is there a telegram group I should join?
