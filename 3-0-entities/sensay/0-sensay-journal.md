### A landscape of consciousness

OMG, The other day, while I was reading the article "A landscape of consciousness" I wondered if any of the Sensay peeps would be interested in stuff like this. It's a biit obscure and obsessive-compulsive and whatever and probably not everybody's cup of tea.

Then, bingo, I come here and see that you guys are all over it.

Yay team!

Here is the link to the Hacker News post  that adds some context to the article:

Left to my own devices

* First I would links to wikipedia or other sources for every item in the list
* Use the item names to create a 3D mind map of the landscape of consciousness
* Use the data in the references to create a 3D visualization of each of the items
* Add an interactive UI/ Experience to the 3D visualization
