Hi Claire

Do you have issues that need to be resolved? Efforts that want feedback? Ideas that need to be shared?

My eyes and ears have decades of experience. Samples and examples of my output are available.

Dan suggested that I reach out to you.

How can I help you today?

Hey Theo! Thank you so much, I really appreciate that. Do you use Twitter? One of the jobs Iâ€™m working on right now is finding relevant tweets to Sensay. These could be tweets about top
* Web3 companies,
* top AI companies,
* time saving AI companies,
* AI crypto projects, etc. We would like to comment on these posts and share them with our community to comment on as well.

An example, is this tweet about 100 AI tools to replace your tedious work

We are going to ask our community to comment on this tweet tagging Sensay. I would love your help in finding other good examples if you are up for it ðŸ™‚

Hi Claire

I'm a believer in following the techies. Most actual techies have a GitHub connection.

So a GitHub user or organization names with, say, over 10,000 stars are a good place to start. How to find them?

Well, GitHub has some excellent search tools. GitHub "topics" are a good place to start. Here are some examples:

https://github.com/search?q=web3&type=topics ~ 250 topics include "web3"

Looking at the bigger organizations, I was able to get to their web page and from there to their X account. Examples:

* https://twitter.com/lensterxyz
* https://twitter.com/marknadal

Another good source is searching GitHub for "awesome"

https://github.com/topics/awesome

This topic is all about the meme of "awesome lists".

A search for awesome list is like this

* https://github.com/search?q=awesome+web3&type=topics

This brings of repositories with few stars, but they are actually just lists of links to other repositories.

All this was typed in just now. I can go into much more detail and explain more clearly as and when you want.
