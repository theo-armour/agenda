# 2024-06-16 Marco Thoughts

Hi Marco,

I'm looking at the Sensay website. For a startup I find it remarkably broad, inclusive, and thoughtful.

1/ I'm looking for places where I can help. I see that there has not been a blog post since February. I could draft two of three blog posts on any topic you proposer And you could tell me if I my writing is on target with your thoughts.

Because I surf the web a lot, I can identify a number of organizations that could use replicas. If there is a playbook to work to, or some standard documents I could start reaching out to some of these organizations and see if they are interested in a pilot.

No matter what, the first thing I should do is start listening in to your daily dialog and identifying issues that come up where I can be of help to you.

Hi Marco,

Thank you for bringing me on board. I'm delighted to serve as your advisor.

I've been reviewing the Sensay website and am impressed by its broad, inclusive, and thoughtful approach, especially for a startup. I'm eager to contribute and have identified a few areas where I can offer assistance.

I noticed that the blog hasn't been updated since February. I would be happy to draft two or three blog posts on any topics you suggest, to ensure my writing aligns with your vision.

Given my extensive web research skills, I can also identify organizations that might benefit from our solutions. If there are any playbooks or standard documents available, I could reach out to these organizations to gauge their interest in a pilot program.

Initially, I believe the most effective way for me to help is by listening to your daily discussions and identifying any issues where I can be of assistance.

Looking forward to collaborating with you.

Best regards,
Tao Armour

To discuss onboarding

Hi Dan
Marco has asked if I would consider being a Sensay advisor. I will be delighted, but the first thing is me sharing my background with you and seeing how that can help progress your vision for Sensay.

In the next fifty years, the Balkan countries like the Baltic countries, given the right opportunities, could become the next beautiful little countries like Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands, etc.
