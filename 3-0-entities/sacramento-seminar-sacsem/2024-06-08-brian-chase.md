Hi Brian

It was great to meet you at the Sacramento Seminar. I look forward to continuing the conversation.

Transcripts of our conversation

Here is a link to two transcripts of our conversation. Plaud is a new device + service that I am trying out. Otter is a service that I have been using for a while.

* Plaud: https://web.plaud.ai/share/b1121718068111397
* Otter: https://otter.ai/u/6_Nl32flIvQQe64c8JtsA8hpqhQ

I think Plaud did a better job.

## Next steps

* Brian adds me as a Wix Admin
* Theo looks into enabling Dick Spotswood being able to add news posts simply by sending it by email
* Theo add his email address to the list of members


## AI-generated psalms

We talked about AI-generated psalms. Below is a copy paste is links to some of the videos. If any further dialog is on interest, there are many more texts and links that can be shared that out line the process.


### Psalm Video links


For the rural, conservative congregation: A Call to Righteous Leadership
You will see a lot of bears in this video. The word "bear" is in the psalm. ;-)

Another version:  A Call to Righteous Leadership ~ https://kaiber.ai/memory/d946bbe7-e670-48f1-b1fd-9e4ad3976b70

For the suburban progressive congregation: A Vision of Compassionate Community

For the urban radical congregation:  A Cry for Justice and Compassion

All these need a way of displaying the text of the psalm as it is being sung. My guess is that I can get this to happen when I upload the videos to YouTube.

What have I learned?
I can use AI to create a psalm that reads and sounds OK. I think I can write better psalms. I would not have known this without seeing AI's examples.

AI is good at giving feedback. So, when I do write a psalm, AI can be my editor.

I am not a musician or animator. I therefore would rely on AI for music and videos. There might be somebody in the diocese who could help.

What is a vision, a prophetic imagination?
I can see establishing a process whereby psalms are written by an AI human partnership on a regular basis for the website or newsletter of a congregation. The psalms reveal the gospels in ways that are topical, relevant and meaningful to a particular congregation.

The practice might extend out to prayers and hymns. With all these media, AI can serve as remedies for the blank piece of paper dilemma and coaches and critics as time goes on.

Let the Good News enthrall people in nice new ways!
