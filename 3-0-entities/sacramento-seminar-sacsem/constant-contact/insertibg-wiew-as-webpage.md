# 2024-08-07 Inserting View as Webpage

Hello Dick, Brian and Dennis

The goal is to automate the process of adding links to Dick's email to https://sacsem.net.

I was a bit slow on getting into Constant Contact, but now once in I can see many possibilities this app offers.

The first part of this is to automate the process of obtaining the permanent URL (link) to the Constant Contact webpage that contains Dick's messages.

It turns out that a "View as Webpage" can be added to every message Dick sends out. With this you "Give contacts the option to view the full version of your email as a webpage by clicking a link in your email." The process is described here:

Dick: I assume you are using a template to help create the messages I very much enjoy receiving. Following these instructions, could you insert a "View as Webpage" button into your template? I suggest either in the footer along with your contact details or (more visibly) somewhere in the header.
