## Why

So. let’s say we really help improve the communication between SPS classmates and get a dialog going between classes. Let’s say the School agrees to fund the hosting and the bandwidth. Let’s say that there are several thousand logons a month.

What would be the greater good that we will have achieved? To what further purpose could this enable?

Putting it another way: I am a highly task-oriented person. I enjoy considering costs and benefits. And I am very time conscious. Living with all my old peeps, I see people’s productivity decreasing and media consumption increasing significantly in their mid-eighties. I am seventy-seven. What I like working on now are likely to be some of my final good works.

Can we come up with some engaging ideas???
