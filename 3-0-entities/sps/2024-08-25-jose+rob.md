Hi Rob & José

Let us not fool ourselves

We were able to bond lat week because of technology and because we are tech advocates. We are not the norm. And actually, I'm sure all three of us have issues dealing dealing with Facebok, discord, instagram, Whatsapp. telegram, Google Messener, Facebok Messenger, Apple Messenger, X, Reddit, LinkedIn, Google Groups, and whatever else is out there.

I don't care how good the technology is, I doubt I could get more than a handful of my class to begin to participate. And if I did get the handful, I doubt I could get them to participate for more than a few weeks unless the content was amazing

I have some experience in this "business". I started https://www.sps65.com/ and https://groups.google.com/g/sps65 in 2005. I know that if I do not push & shove, scream & shout then nothing happens.

Rather than looking at the technology first,we need to look at what we are trying to accomplish.

* We are not here to raise money for the School. it has nearly $700 million already
* We are not likely to get money from the School

Vision

* We are here to help the School rediscover itself
* We are here to help live the school prayer
* We are here to start a revolution

5 pm CDT is good for me

I've never used Jitsi. Looks good to me.
