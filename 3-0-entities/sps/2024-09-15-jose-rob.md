# Don't knock success. Knock somewhere else

I have just read this article again:

https://danieloppenheimer.substack.com/p/the-greatest-trick-the-elite-ever

The entire article rings true. For myself, I can trace the changes in my worldview from entitled brat growing up in a gilded cage to whatever I am now - which is, fingers crossed, not what is was (but one never knows). So every sentence resonates.

My takeaway: SPS is a very successful system, revered by thousands. Successful systems are extremely difficult to change. Even imperfections are hard to fix. One person's bug can become another person's feature.

BTW, it took ten years of my life trying to add new features to financial data visualization to realize that peeps like Bloomberg were coining much too fast, were so successful, that considering new features was an anathema: The mantra: Don't make me learn. Don't make me think. Don't make me change. It was a hard lesson for me to learn

I am not sure what the answer is, but perhaps "Don't fix what isn't broken" is a good place to start.

Let us try to identify something that needs fixing, something that is broken. Or let us create something cool out of nothing. Or whatever. Just don't forget: SPS is old school.

In any case, I would be very please to hear what you think of Oppenheimer's article.
