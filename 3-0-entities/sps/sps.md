We must convince ourselves - and then others that our project is good. I am in the middle of a bunch of things again, but I am taking a moment to dream of possibilities I would like to strive for.

Here are five thoughts off the top of my head:

Vision - where our future may be heading

* SPS is a trusted, authoritative and productive pedagogical and socialization resource for secondary schools around the world ( A Wikipedia for educators)
* Every year thousands of students and teachers of all ages and backgrounds enjoy the SPS experience ( Boy Scout Jubilee)
* The organization is a model of beauty and sustainability (Burning Man, World Economic Forum)
* Diet, health, fitness and the abilities to get things done compete head on head with STEAM compete head on head with kindness, knowledge and belief ( A course by Tim Ferriss)
* Saint Paul's School - and its forks - are resources for life. ( Bohemian Club)

Mission ~ what we do now

* We enable messaging between Facebook, Slack, Twitter, LinkedIn and Alumnifire
* We moderate, curate and prioritize the best ideas and while never forgetting the fails and the lessons learned
* We help people of disparate backgrounds make decisions that bring us together

## Crumpacker as trustee / petition to remove

Back on September 1, in an earlier thread in the trustee topic Butch wrote:

> Please let's not make our ‘google group’ about politics. There is way too much of this everywhere and too many people I know are losing friends over rhetoric which spins out of control. If you want to send these out personally thats fine with me….but let’s keep our ‘google group’ out of the Political spectrum. I know this crosses the boundaries, but I would prefer to stay away.

I'm with Butch. And yet I signed the petition almost immediately. Here are three criteria for an SPS trustee along with a number of Crumpacker statements that convinced me to sign.

## 1. Separation of Church and State is proper

With the departure from the US Supreme Court of a practicing Jew and the likely arrival of a practicing Catholic, we are reminded of the relationships between church and state.

We can review the thoughts of Jon Locke and other on separation of church and state here

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state

We can review the "wall of separation" as defined by Jefferson.

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state_in_the_United_States

We can double click into the issues of Judge Barrett's Catholicism here:

* https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/opinion/sunday/amy-coney-barrett-catholic-supreme-court.html


Matters related to religion relate to timeless beliefs or truths, to personal choices as opposed to societal choices, to absolute and rather and relative judgments. Also the beliefs of my neighbors may differ greatly from mine and that is OK.

Matters relating to government are created in a timely fashion, in moments of need, they must be agreed as many people as possible. Laws are compromises, crafted to resolve issues of the moment, based on what is known at the time. The seek to make things better as opposed to the best.

The two mindsets differ greatly. History tells us that governments run by religions and religions run by governments both have issues.

In the moment or timeless: A church school should have trustees that think long term, not just about a next election.
Personal or societal: that religions are sectarian, the trustee should support the specific ongoing ideals of the involved and the purpose of the school is to prepare the individual to enter in society
Absolute or relative. The purpose of the school is to help the student establish a core unwavering belief system.

A trustee should be someone that the institution can, heh heh, trust. Therefore:

The selection process for a trustee for Saint Paul's should stipulate that a member of a government - an elected or appointed official or one running for office or hoping to be appointed to office shall not serve on the board of trustees of a church school.


## 2. St. Paul’s School's "Our Values" are good values

The SPS value system is outlined here https://www.sps.edu/about

### Mission

... St. Paul's School models and teaches a respect for self and others; for one's spiritual, physical, and emotional well-being; for the natural environment; and for service to a greater good.

### Inclusivity

As a fully residential academic community founded in the Episcopal tradition and rooted in enduring humanistic values, St. Paul’s School welcomes and affirms the dignity of all human beings. The work of strengthening equity and inclusivity requires deep listening with open hearts and open minds. We honor and affirm the experiences of our students, faculty, and staff as critical to building a more inclusive and beloved community. Finally, we take our moral responsibility seriously: to prepare our students to work together as global citizens committed to ongoing civil discourse, to aspire to transform the world in service toward a greater good.

### Honor Code

To live honorably, we as members of the St. Paul’s community strive to be truthful, respectful, and kind.

### The School Prayer

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."

I feel that the values expressed on this About page are values that are very similar to the values of the school when we were there and also when my father and grandfather were students. These values are timeless, absolute and personal. These are religious values not governing values. It would be very difficult to craft a law firing you to be thoughtful of of those less happy than you.

Both liberals and conservatives could include these values in their platforms.

The selection process for a trustee for Saint Paul's should stipulate that the candidate can demonstrate a history of being thoughtful and inclusive.


## 3. Being a "Scholar Athlete" is a noble feat worthy of being sought.

A concept we heard often at SPS was "scholar-athlete". It would be nice if a trustee embodies some aspect of these qualities.

he selection process for a trustee for Saint Paul's should stipulate that the candidate demonstrates some aspects off being  scholar athlete. For example:

1. Scholar: The trustee has created content - writing, research, art, goods or services or other tangible output respected by peers
2. Athlete: The trustee has demonstrated team leadership and / or has been involved with star performances


## Jim Crumpacker

Because Mtr Crumpacker had run for a political office, it is possible to gain insight into his temperament. Below are some quotes I gathered from his speeches and advertising. Here are some of Crumpacker's thoughts:

"but with liberals run amuk in Portland and Washington DC, Jimmy C came back to fight for our way of life for our small towns, for our timber industry"

"to destroy the federal regulation machine"

"These days Congress wants to tear down your house cancel your health insurance raise your taxes and impeach the president"

"end socialism once and for all"

"Send 'em packing"

The above quotes were taken from these web pages:

* https://www.wweek.com/news/2020/04/09/thomas-lauderdale-wants-his-money-back-from-jimmy-crumpacker/
* https://www.facebook.com/CrumpackerforCongress/videos/834272000374192

* https://www.facebook.com/CrumpackerforCongress/


## Conclusions

Reviewing the three criteria for a trustee and considering Crumpacker's words, my guess is that:

1. Separation of church and state: Crumpacker appears to be anti-separation
2. School values: bearing the burdens of other and being inclusive are not Crumpacker strong suits
3. Scholar Athlete: Being a volunteer meals-on-wheels driver does not get you the Gordon medal

While it is OK that buildings are named for the Crumpacker family because of their generous donations and OK that the Rector entertains the Crumpackers and lets them stay at Scudder House and so on, I cannot in any way condone SPS's choice of Crumpacker as a trustee.

Matthew 19:23-26 KJV says "it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God". Being an SPS trustee could follow this game plan.

## 2020-07-26

Jose and fellow Paulies (apparently "fellow" is gender neutral - kick me if it ain't ;-)

Thank you all for an engaging, considered and intentional diallog.

In all of this I am reminded of a text we all know:

The School Payer

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."

What resonates is that it is written in the present tense and is forward looking. There are no admissions of past guilt. There are no expressions of gratitude for past joys. 

Rory, Brent and Alexis: I hear you - and yet you are not as forward looking as the prayer. You discuss a past that I share. In my case, Bishop Walker and my '65 classmate Bob Hall were the first Black people I ever had a dialog with. For sure SPS has been less bad than many. For sure SPS - over the decades - has chosen to lift fingers many times. For sure we mostly did not forget to be kind.

Nonetheless there are still vast swaths of people in this world that have been and are denied the joy, friendship and happiness that we have all prayed for just because of their race.

The thrust in Jose's text is - like the School Prayer - forward looking. His text asks the School to evolve so as to be eager to bear the burdens of others. He asks that we the members of the School's community create plans for how to be thoughtful of those less happy.

The representation of a pelican piercing its breast to feed its young with its own blood is called a “Pelican in her Piety.”. We all know this symbol well:

![]( https://bbk12e1-cdn.myschoolcdn.com/ftpimages/36/logo/SPS-logo-2019-fullColor.png )


Now,  I'm not sure Jose wants us all to pierce our breasts, but I feel he is asking us to remember, to be unselfish and to bear the burdens of others. It's a bloody good idea.

Jose

Thank you for sharing. I signed. And I think I was the oldest alum ( '65 ) to do so when I signed. 

I believe you are saying and doing the right thing. My guess is that the School will agree on some items and push back on others. Consider Luthor's 95 Theses. They took a long time to process. Some outcomes worked and others did not. But the concept and the effort did change the Western world.

Having said that I would like to see more

We stand on the shoulders of giants

Your thoughts came from somewhere. Sharing links to sources that resonated or inspired what you say would a thing that a good scholar athlete would do

 Something not to forget: The School Prayer

"Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen."

This year Saint Paul's graduated 150 nearly perfectly educated young people while the country they live in graduated something like 3.7 million young people with many finishing with problematic circumstances

What can the former do to help the latter? How can we be the pelican that pecks its own breast to feed its young?

Third point

* Black yet Integrated 
* What tips and tricks can we the alums pass on?
* Future of NE boarding school movement?
* We performed at SPS - yearbook prep. What do we do now?

### 2020-07-20?

* Zoom all my SPS class mates
* spend a weeked or so with each. two or three tals in different venues
* 10 good questions we spend hours trying to answer
* Interested if there is a project, a mission
* SPS65.com?? will fix photos
