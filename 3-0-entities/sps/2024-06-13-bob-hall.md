 As soon as the alumni office has settled on a date for our in-person reunion, Rick Saunders and I will have Randy Morgan send out a modified version of his 'save-the-date' survey seeking to ascertain how many of us plan to attend.
 In the meantime, I am reaching out to you individually to solicit your ideas about the reunion. Should we try to have a pre-reunion gathering similar to the one we had at Mount Washington immediately before our 50th? etc.

Hello Bob

Thank you for getting going with the 60th reunion of the class of 1965

I wonder if this will be a yet another gathering of old men partying or a perhaps more a deeper or meaningful gathering
