Hi Randy

I have attached an Excel spreadsheet that contains a list of many ( but not all ) of the email addresses of our classmates.

I started with exporting the names in the sps65 Google Group and the used the yearbook to fill in missing names. I downloaed the list today, so I assume it has all the latest changes you made.

The symbols in my spreadsheet:

~~ deceased
?? email address for who
** classmate with multiple addresses

You will see a number of addresses where we do nt know who they are for. This could be tricky as email addresses of the deceased can get taken over by people who are not nice.

You will also see the names of a number of classmates who are not (and may have never been ) in the Google Group. I suggest we add them to the Google Group ASAP.

Please feel free to update the spreadsheet and send it back to me. Upon return with additions I will email every classmate individually to confirm we have the best email and that they wish to be included in the Google Group.

Cheers,

Theo
