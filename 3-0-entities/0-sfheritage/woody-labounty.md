Hi Woody

And, in return, I am sorry for my slow reply.

Spec's
I was hoping to attend my first SF Heritage Happy Hour at one of my old hangouts tonight. Fingers crossed: next time works

I an leading a tour of the eight Glow SF installations this evening. I hope it helps inspire some of my fellow residents to consider helping with a modern illumination system for the Julia Morgan at Heritage on the Marina

Collaboration
>> We will be very happy to share and “report” on the anniversary event in March and I will try to squeeze in some of the great history

Just give a holler and I can draft and prepare any texy or images you might need. I am very happy to help.

Newsletter
Here is a link to the December Heritage Happenings: https://heritage-happenings.github.io/happenings-issues/2024/2024-12-happenings-newsletter.pdf

This is the monthly newsletter I edit and publish. Thinking out loud: should future issues include a box somewhere with some interesting aspect of San Francisco Heritage? An event past, present or future, perhaps?

Roses of 3400 Laguna
Here links to the papers I submitted to the Planning Commission and the Historic Commission for the Draft EIR for 3400 Laguna Street:

Hi Woody

Vision
Today was wonderful. Much as I adore living at Heritage on the Marina, it is very rare to be with someone who actually looks at examines they are seeing (architecturally ;-). And there you were at the south side of the Morgan building, just standing and thinking and examining the brickwork. Yay!

Links

Link to my scans of the structural engineers drawings:

All of these are on a website that I maintain from time to time that gets very occasional visits.

Ah! And, almost forgot, as promised here is the November Heritage Happenings:

What's Next
The date for the Julia Morgan Building Centenary is March 27 2025. You will be invited. Lurie, Stefani, Newsom(?) ditto. Feel free to suggest people of interest.

That event will be a people party thing, which is very nice. Nonetheless there is surely a coterie of peeps that have an actual design and architectural interest in this fair city—people who at various future times would enjoy a tour, a party, a gathering here. Being a transplant, I have few if any of this type of connections. Your online published efforts and your real world events are outstanding. I very much welcome your insights, observations and guidance.

Cheers,

Theo
