Continue developing the ideas??

* Data clouds to hbJSON - and back??
* Sensore everywhere - sensing what?
* Continuously updating the building with 3D printing robots
* The building as a signboard
* The building as a power generator



CAD-lint and Office-lint

These apers were written in 2009. They anticipate online collaboration - like Google Docs, app stores and push notifications. But they also suggest a push-snooping that we are beginning to see with GitHub Actions, Webhooks and more.

A good future goal will be to help people check and validate AEC projects and processes.

Machines for Living

The title is a play on Le Corbusier's "A house is a machine for living in."

This paper is from 2012 Never completed. It starts to propose ways of unifying the efforts of multiple staff, projects and offices.

The basic idea is you use whatever tools, data formats and procedures that you want to use. We - with our technology - make sure that what another person views through their tools, data formats and procedures is the equal or equivalent of what you see.

Example:

Architect looking at 3D model program
Electrical engineer looking at circuit diagram
M&E looking at piping schematic

All are looking at the same thing, but each is seeing what they need to see - in near real time.

Thank you for checking in. I'm getting better, but it's taking time.

I'm back in my apartment.  This is both good and bad.

It's good to be home.

It's bad to be confronted once more with all the things I want to do, could do, should do, don't want to do and more. ;-)

BRW, our next scheduled meeting is on December 15.  I hope to have a new five-year plan to discuss with you. Many of my 3D mapping, data viz and UX wish list items of the last ten years are now being actively worked on by talented experts. It's time to move on. It's time to look ahead again. Probably has to include 3DAI, cross-discipline, collaboration and more!
