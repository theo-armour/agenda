Hi everyone. Thank you Alberto. My name is Theo Armour. I'm with Ladybug Tools - the designers and builders for well-known Rhino / Grasshopper and Revit / Dynamo plugins. These are all free open-soure apps hosted on GitHub. They are designed to help you with illumination and energy analysis.

More specifically: I am the designer and maintainer of the Spider gbXML Viewer - available as the online viewer app at gbXML.org.
