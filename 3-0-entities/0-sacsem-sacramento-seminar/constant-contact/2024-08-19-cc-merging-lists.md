Background

* Sacramento Seminar (SacSem) is a private "club" of just under a hundred dues paying members
* SacSem currently communicates updates via uses a Constant Contact (CC) account run by Dick Spotswood (415 260 3235) of Mill Valley, CA
* SacSem is seeking to upgrade and enhance communication with its members
* Theo Armour (me) is steering this effort
* The objective is to create a new CC account with multiple users
* We would like to have three users with the ability to send messages
* Also, We would be pleased to have a different user (not one of the above) who can access the account to monitor and pay the bills
* We would like to copy the current SacSem CC template and contact list from Spotswood's account to the new account


## Things to keep in mind

* Spotswood is a great writer not not at all a techie
* Besides the SacSem list, Spotswood currently runs multiple mailing lists from his account
* None of these lists must in any way be affected to the transfer/upgrade to the new account
* Any interaction with Spotswood will take gentle and sensitive, human hand-holding during the entire process
* Any dealings with me can be reasonably high level. I run a number of mailing lists via Google Groups and Groups.io

Questions

* Will it be possible simply to export and download Spotswood's templates and and list and then upload them to the new account?
* Would there be any issues with the transfer?
* Would there be any issues With two accounts posting to the same audience?
* Will it be possible for Spotswood to continue to use his account for his other lists without having to log out and log back in?
* Would it be possible for a CC team member to assist Spotswood with the transfer?
* Would be possible for a CC team member to assist with ensuring that all the lists are properly set up and functioning correctly?
* Being a non-profit with mostly very elderly members, would there be any special pricing or services available to us?
