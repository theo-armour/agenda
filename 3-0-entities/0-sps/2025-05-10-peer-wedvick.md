# 2025-05-10 Peer Wedvick

Dear Class of ’65,

It is with deep sadness that I inform you of the passing of Peer Wedvick, who died on Sunday night here in California.

For the past ten days, I’ve been in close contact with his wife, Phyllis, as she kept me updated on Peer's declining health. Although I couldn’t attend our reunion, I feel it important to remain connected and informed.

I know this news will be especially jarring so soon after your time together. Peer was very much part of our shared history at SPS. I’m sure many of you have special memories of Peer.

If you’d like to share your memories of Peer, I know it would bring comfort to all of us as we reflect on his life and the times we shared.

With sympathy,

Theo

Theo:

I’m so sorry for Peer and Phyllis. From what I understand the past few months have been a struggle for them. Reading between the lines it appears that they have not had much family support but as a class I’m glad that a few of us have been trying to fill a void.

Thank you for being with them in a meaningful way at the end.

There will be many more words to share in the coming days. We missed you in Concord.

Rest in peace, Peer.

Laurie

Morning Theo. Phyllis and I have been in touch. She is so grateful for your love and support. Who can forget that Sixth Form Show tour de force? Much love to you and thanks for all you’ve done. JR

Thank you, Theo, for letting us know.  I always liked Peer.  His peacockish ways amused me no end and did not detract from what I always felt was his kind and gentle soul.  I’m sorry that both of you were unable to attend the reunion. You would have enjoyed it very much.  What a great group of guys everyone has turned out to be.  If you’re ever in New Orleans, you must call and come see me (and Janet).  (504)259-6688. Scott

Sad news.
 
Theo, has Peer been recently suffering with a serious illness?  Peter Twining

Thanks for passing that message along, Theo. As I recall, Peer was quite the high-class character. The only thing he was missing was a Top Hat!  I was certainly never part of his clique, however. I can only imagine that there were/are some interesting stories/adventures/yarns about him that our classmates might be able to enlighten us with.  He always seemed very aloof to me, but, then again, I arrived as a Fourth Form “Newbie” with all that came along with that label, LOL!
