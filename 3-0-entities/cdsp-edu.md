Dear Student,

Welcome to online learning through the Center for Anglican Learning & Leadership (CALL) at Church Divinity School of the Pacific (CDSP). The Diaconal Hermeneutic, taught by Dr. Rod Dugliss, will begin Monday, April 8, 2024, at 9:00 AM PDT. Please note that the course is asynchronous and you can log in at any time after 9 AM during the first day.
We encourage you to save these instructions on your computer and/or to print them out for future reference.

Required texts:

Walter Brueggemann, The Prophetic Imagination.
Getting Started: remember your course will not be visible until 9 AM PDT on the first day of class

Go to Moodle: Connect your computer to the internet. Open your Internet browser and go to https://moodle.cdsp.edu/. We recommend that you use the Google Chrome browser (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), as Moodle does not work as well with other browsers, especially Safari, and may not display properly on tablet devices.

Log in with your username and password, which you will receive by separate email from Moodle Admin before the course begins (check your Spam or Junk Email folder if you don’t see it.)

Note: If you have taken a CALL course within the last two years, you will not receive a new login and password.
If you do not remember your password, click on the “Lost Password?” link in the Login block. Enter your username (first initial, last name – ex. Justin Welby would be jwelby) in the field. The Moodle system will send an e-mail to you with instructions on resetting your password (to the address with which you registered for the course). If you do not receive a password within 24 hours, or have other difficulties, please contact the CALL Online Course Administrator at call@cdsp.edu.

Go directly to your course: In the top left box, click on “My Courses”. You will see your course listed.
OR Go to the CALL section: In the main portion of your screen click on “CALL>Spring2024.”
Go to your course. The course names will appear when you click “CALL>Spring2024”. Remember, the course name is not visible until the day the course begins. When it is visible, click on it and begin! All interaction with the course starts on this page. Once you are on the course page, focus on the main area of the course in the center column. Your instructor will explain how you should proceed.

The Course

CALL online courses work on a weekly rhythm. The course is “asynchronous.” In other words, there are no required meeting times. You should plan to go to the course site at least three times throughout the week, on your own schedule. At the beginning of each week the instructor will post lectures, videos, podcasts, readings, assignments, discussion questions or other course materials. Each week will include at least one discussion “forum” where typed conversation between you, your classmates and your instructor takes place. While you will develop your own rhythm with the class, try to complete the readings or lectures early in the week and then post to discussion forum and respond to your classmates’ postings by mid-week. Don’t be afraid to be the first to post! When you next return to the course later in the week, the conversation in the discussion forum should have grown. Read through other postings and respond to them. Try to respond to at least two of your classmates’ postings at some point during each week, in addition to your own original posting.

Important Tips:

Compose your forum postings or replies in Microsoft Word or a similar program, and then copy/paste them into the forum. This will save you the frustration of needing to re-compose your posting in the event of a system timeout or lost connectivity to the Moodle site.

The forum times out automatically after 30 minutes even if you have been typing sporadically, so it is especially important to compose elsewhere and paste, thus avoiding lost work. You must click on Submit within 30 minutes of starting a posting.

If you wish to earn CEUs, you must post to the discussion forum weekly. The instructor will assign a short paper or project at the end of the course that is required for CEU students and is optional for others. This assignment allows your instructor to assess your ability to integrate the material covered in the course and to provide feedback to you. You will not be able to receive CEUs if you do not complete the final integration assignment. CEU certificates will be sent to you once the instructor has graded your final assignment.

Late Withdrawal

You may withdraw from a CALL course without penalty until the end of the second week of the course. After that time a 50% administrative fee will be assessed. Students are responsible for notifying both the instructor and the CALL office by the end of the second week. Exceptions will be made for emergencies or special circumstances.

Help with Moodle

If you need additional help, please consult the Moodle Student FAQ Tutorials page (https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Student_FAQ) or e-mail the CALL Program Manager at call@cdsp.edu. Please include the phrase “Moodle Help” in the subject heading of your e-mail and describe your problem in detail. We will respond within one business day.

Enjoy the class!
