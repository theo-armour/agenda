Hi Frank

Some great items on your AI list! Thank you.

Here are some of the Ai products that I'm using

* https://suno.com/ ~ Make a song about anything
* https://kaiber.ai/ ~ Turn text, videos, photos, and music to videos

I'm also using some of the tools you mentioned. I'm looking forward to trying out the ones I haven't used yet.

Here are some of my AI issues that still need to be resolved:

Problem: It's difficult to remember that there is a relevant specialized AI tool available when I'm working on a specific task.

Solution: I need an AI tool that reminds me that there is an interesting AI tool to try out while I'm actually doing something interesting.

Problem: I'm quite good at keeping to routines. But I need to be reminded that it's time for one to kick in especially when I'm in the middle of something else and want to add some new aspect to an existing routine.

Problem: When mindlessly doom-scrolling, it would be great to be alerted that I'm doing so and that there are some interesting alternatives to look at.

Solution: I need AI models that have a positive impact on my life.
