## Ray-Ban

Heart the camera concept. But glasses (can't remember name) I had last year were better. I could see the image of what I was looking at and they had very good zoom. But was mechanically primitive and vendor failed.

I very much like that you can stream to Instagram. I just wish I had more streamable things in my life. I should try to stream the Wednesday lunch with Philip and me

The AI is just OK. Not nearly as interactive as ChatGPT with realtime voice. Not as connected as Google Gemini.

## Viture Pro XR

Glasses are mostly designed for content consumers, not for content creators.

My vision was to be able to use the glasses as a multi-monitor setup on a laptop in a Paris cafe. But for now only one monitor is virtual on Windows (not on MacOS). The other is real. Switching eye focus between the two is distracting.

But no camera and no microphone.

## Meta Orion Glasses

The future is visible. When will it get here?
