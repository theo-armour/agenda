# Week 4


I can relate to most of Rod's points Except for the first that the diagnostic is gospel-based.

I have just looked at the gospel mark and I see that there are about 80 significant elements to the gospel I have not looked at the other gospels, but I assume in total of the four canonical gospels is probably not more than about 200 elements. By elements I made parables and other. Little stories that can be identified as an entity. I gathered these from the Gospel of Mark in Wikipedia.

There is not a lot of source material. Are there 1000 ideas, 2000 at the most?

It seems to me that it would be difficult to come up with anything new or anything that hadn't been heard before when trying to prophecies the gospels And they only apply to a limited number of situations. So the applicability to whatever you're looking at today may be quite. may be quite remote If any relation exists at all. 


## Humpty Dumpty

When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean — neither more nor less.”
“The question is,” said Alice, “whether you can make words mean so many different things.”
“The question is,” said Humpty Dumpty, “which is to be master – – that’s all.”


## diaconal hermeneutic Session 4

The Diaconal Hermeneutic is—
 • Gospel based ~ of proclaiming—not just reading—the Gospel
 • Prophet informed ~ the public interpretation of Scripture (not predicting the future)
 • baptismally realized
 • systemic and critical
 • relational
 • heart broken and compassionate
 • real not theoretical

Here's a summary of the document:
Main ideas:
The concept and rationale of a diaconal hermeneutic: The document introduces the idea of a diaconal hermeneutic, which is a framework for interpreting the world and the church from the perspective of the deacon's ministry. The document argues that the deacon's distinctive role and identity shape a hermeneutic that is gospel-based, prophet-informed, baptismally realized, systemic and critical, relational, heart broken and compassionate, and real not theoretical.12
The challenges and benefits of a diaconal hermeneutic: The document acknowledges the difficulties and objections that the deacon may face in applying and articulating a diaconal hermeneutic, such as being accused of being political, partisan, or cranky, or being isolated or ignored by the church. The document also suggests some ways that the deacon can overcome these challenges, such as grounding the hermeneutic in the gospel, the prophetic tradition, the baptismal covenant, and the liturgy, and using critical and relational skills to analyze and engage with the world. The document claims that a diaconal hermeneutic can help the deacon to be a faithful and effective witness of the good news and the needs, concerns, and hopes of the world.34
The connection between the diaconal hermeneutic and the prophetic imagination: The document briefly refers to the work of Walter Brueggemann on the prophetic imagination, which is the ability to envision and enact an alternative reality that challenges the dominant culture and its systems of oppression and injustice. The document suggests that the diaconal hermeneutic is aligned with the prophetic imagination, as both seek to nurture and nourish a consciousness and perception that is based on the covenantal relationship with God and the call to serve the marginalized and the oppressed. The document also notes the difficulty of being prophetic in a context that is influenced by individualism, royal consciousness, and establishment.56

Here's a summary of the document:
The document explores the concept and rationale of a diaconal hermeneutic, which is a way of interpreting the world and the church from the perspective of the deacon's ministry.12

The deacon's ministry is defined by its distinct nature and identity among the three historic orders of the church, as well as by its liturgical and pastoral functions of proclaiming the gospel, interpreting the needs, concerns, and hopes of the world, and inviting the church to respond in service and advocacy.13

The document argues that the deacon's role and identity shape a hermeneutic that is gospel-based, prophet-informed, baptismally realized, systemic and critical, relational, heart broken and compassionate, and real not theoretical.45  The document acknowledges the difficulties and objections that the deacon may face in applying and articulating a diaconal hermeneutic, such as being accused of being political, partisan, or cranky, or being isolated or ignored by the church.67

The Deacon shines a beacon that beckons

This week's reading is provocative, informative and engaging. Very. Thank you, Rod.

You are looking at the diaconate from multiple lenses - each of which follows a triad I have usedL Google EAT for search engine optimization (SEO): Expertise, Authority, Trustworthiness.

Each of the of the points or lenses includes a homiletic narrative or parable that draws in the reader.

The document "eats its own dog food" - it is a model of the diaconal hermeneutic it is describing in that it includes a prophetic narrative that is grounded in what we will be "eating" in the next few weeks. ;-)

In the next few days I hope to parse the sections headings in more detail. Perhaps, I will try to summarize them, or try to locate sources or greater detail for each, or perhaps just come up with questions that might be asked in a discussion group.

Again, thank you, Rod, for a very engaging and thought-provoking document.
