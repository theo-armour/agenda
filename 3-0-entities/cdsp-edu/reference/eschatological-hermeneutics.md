# # Eschatological hermeneutics

Certainly! Let's delve into the fascinating realm of **eschatological hermeneutics**.

**Hermeneutics** refers to the principles and methods used for interpreting Scripture. When it comes to **eschatology**, which deals with the study of end times and the fulfillment of biblical prophecies, our approach to interpretation becomes crucial.

Here are some key points related to eschatological hermeneutics:

1. **Consistently Literal Interpretation**:
   * We adhere to a hermeneutical system that interprets all Scripture using a consistently literal or normal method.
   * Our paradigm involves **grammatical, contextual, theological, and historical exegesis** to discern the **authorial intent** behind biblical texts.

2. **Dual Hermeneutics**:
   * We believe that the same hermeneutical principles should govern the interpretation of both the Old and New Testaments.
   * Rejecting any approach that treats Old Testament prophecies differently based on their subject matter (e.g., first advent vs. second advent).

3. **Typology**:
   * We recognize points of correspondence between the Old and New Testaments.
   * Some of us limit this correspondence to explicit textual correlations, while others see implicit correlations that enhance earlier revelation.

4. **Multiple Fulfillments**:
   * In our commitment to literal interpretation, we encounter New Testament passages where the connection to Old Testament antecedents isn't obvious.
   * Some passages imply fulfillments not explicitly found in the original prophecies. We view these as analogies or expansions of meaning.

5. **Dual Authorship**:
   * We acknowledge that biblical autographs involve at least two participants: a human agent and God.
   * Whether viewing this authorship as **unitary** (confluence of divine-human wording and meaning) or **binary** (cooperation with fuller divine meaning), we reject adding new meaning to Old Testament texts.

6. **Inaugurated Eschatology**:
   * We recognize that major eschatological prophecies to national Israel remain unfulfilled.
   * Rejecting any application of inaugurated eschatology that blurs the distinction between Israel and the church, we affirm the literal consummation of Old Testament promises and propheciesÂ¹.

In summary, eschatological hermeneutics guides us in understanding the grand narrative of God's plan for humanity, from creation to ultimate fulfillment. ðŸŒŸðŸ“œ
