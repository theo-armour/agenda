## Baptismal Covenant

* https://www.episcopalchurch.org/what-we-believe/baptismal-covenant/

>The baptismal covenant, found on p. 304-5 of The Book of Common Prayer, is a small catechism for use during the rite of initiation into the Church. Armentrout and Slocum, in their An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, note that the baptismal covenant “is widely regarded as the normative statement of what it means to follow Christ” (p. 37); in these questions and answers, the congregation expresses the ways each of the faithful will live their faith both inside and outside the church walls.
>
>The first four questions are patterned on the Apostles’ Creed, with the liturgy’s celebrant asking the people about their beliefs in each of the members of the Trinity, along with a concise understanding of their natures. Following these questions, the covenant includes five questions regarding how we, as Christians, are called to live out our faith: with firm commitment and a reliance on God’s help.

The Baptismal Covenant

* Celebrant: Do you believe in God the Father?
* People: I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
* Celebrant: Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God?
* People: I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
* He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
* Celebrant: Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit?
* People: I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.
* Celebrant: Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you persevere in resisting evil, and, whenever you fall into sin, repent and return to the Lord?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you proclaim by word and example the Good News of God in Christ?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you seek and serve Christ in all persons, loving your neighbor as yourself?
* People: I will, with God’s help.
* Celebrant: Will you strive for justice and peace among all people, and respect the dignity of every human being?
* People: I will, with God’s help.


## Beatitudes

The Beatitudes (/biˈætɪtjudz/) are sayings of Jesus, and in particular eight or nine blessings recounted by Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew, and four in the Sermon on the Plain in the Gospel of Luke, followed by four woes which mirror the blessings. Each is a proverb-like proclamation, without narrative.

## Diakonia

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaconia

>An alternative spelling, diakonia, is a Christian theological term from Greek that encompasses the call to serve the poor and oppressed. The terms deaconess and diaconate also come from the same root, which refers to the emphasis on service within those vocations. In scripture deacons were those whom the Church appointed to dispense alms, and take care of the poor.


## Doxology

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxology

>A doxology [Ancient Greek: δοξολογία doxologia, from δόξα, doxa 'glory' and -λογία, -logia 'saying' is a short hymn of praises to God in various forms of Christian worship, often added to the end of canticles, psalms, and hymns.

## Exigesis

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis

>Exegesis is a critical explanation or interpretation of a text, particularly a religious text. Traditionally the term was used primarily for work with the Bible; however, in modern usage biblical exegesis is used for greater specificity to distinguish it from any other broader critical text explanation.

## Hermeneutics

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics

>Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts. Modern hermeneutics includes both verbal and non-verbal communication as well as semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history, theology, and philosophy.


### Techie interpretation

Exigesis = "Double-clicking" ~ opening something in the default application.

Hermeneutics = Copy-pasting" ~ reappropriating the content for reuse.


### Architectural Interpretation

Exigesis = "Reading the blueprints"

Hermeneutics = "Understanding the architect's vision"

### Constitutional Hermeneutic Principles and Constitutional Interpretation

* https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-31739-7_91-1

>Interpretation is a fact of law. It is thought that the law invites interpretation on the basis of a codification that has been established from a hierarchy of sources. Faced with a normative reality in which different reading criteria are established, hermeneutics appear as a tool at the service of the interpreter, so that the essential relevance that appears in order to establish the most appropriate interpretation can be established. The issue affects constitutional law, since many legal questions (laws, regulations, and sentences) end up being judged under the protection of constitutional interpretation. The constitution is thus presented as a hermeneutic criterion when evaluating legal work, since it is at the top of the pyramid of the sources of a state’s law. However, its legal preeminence leads to another preliminary question which is also hermeneutical in nature and which answers the question: What does the constitution mean and how should it be interpreted?


### Judicial interpretation

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_interpretation

>Judicial interpretation refers to different ways that the judiciary uses to interpret the law, particularly constitutional documents and legislation. This is an important issue in some common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, because the supreme courts of those nations can overturn laws made by their legislatures via a process called judicial review. This power creates the potential for the judiciary to be able to make law, and is why judicial interpretation is a significant issue.


### Originalism

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism

>Originalism is a method of constitutional and statutory interpretation. Originalists assert that legal text should be interpreted based on the original understanding at the time of adoption. Originalists object to the idea of the significant legal evolution being driven by judges in a common law framework and instead favor modifications of laws through the Legislature or through Constitutional amendment.


### Historiography

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography

Historiography was more recently defined as "the study of the way history has been and is written—the history of historical writing", which means that, "When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians."

## Homiletics

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homiletics

>In religious studies, homiletics (Ancient Greek: ὁμιλητικός[1] homilētikós, from homilos, "assembled crowd, throng"[2]) is the application of the general principles of rhetoric to the specific art of public preaching.[1] One who practices or studies homiletics may be called a homilist, or more simply, a preacher.


## Homily

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homily

>A homily (from Greek ὁμιλία, homilía) is a commentary that follows a reading of scripture,[1] giving the "public explanation of a sacred doctrine" or text. The works of Origen[2] and John Chrysostom [known as Paschal Homily](3) are considered exemplary forms of Christian homily.[4]


## Lament

A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner in which participants lament about something that they regret or someone that they have lost, and they are usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing, and examples exist across human cultures.


## Orders

## Ordination

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination

>There are three ordinations in Holy Orders: deacon, presbyter, and bishop. Both bishops and presbyters are priests and have authority to celebrate the Eucharist. In common use, however, the term priest, when unqualified, refers to the order of presbyter, whereas presbyter is mainly used in rites of ordination and other places where a technical and precise term is required.


## https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet

In religion, a prophet or prophetess is an individual who is regarded as being in contact with a divine being and is said to speak on behalf of that being, serving as an intermediary with humanity by delivering messages or teachings from the supernatural source to other people.[1][2] The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy.

Prophethood has existed in many cultures and religions throughout history, including Mesopotamian religion, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Manichaeism, Islam, the Baháʼí Faith, and Thelema.


## Pentecost

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost

> Pentecost (also called Whit Sunday, Whitsunday or Whitsun) is a Christian holiday which takes place on the 49th day (50th day when inclusive counting is used) after Easter Sunday.[1] It commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Mary, mother of Jesus and the Apostles of Jesus while they were in Jerusalem celebrating the Feast of Weeks, as described in the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1–31).[2] While the Catholic Church believes the Holy Spirit descended upon Mary, this is not recorded in the New Testament.


## Praxis of Good News

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_theological_praxis

>Christian theological praxis is a term used by most liberation theologians to express how the Gospel of Jesus Christ is to be lived in the world.


## Prophecy

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy

In religion, a prophecy is a message that has been communicated to a person (typically called a prophet) by a supernatural entity. Prophecies are a feature of many cultures and belief systems and usually contain divine will or law, or preternatural knowledge, for example of future events. They can be revealed to the prophet in various ways depending on the religion and the story, such as visions, divination, or direct interaction with divine beings in physical form. Stories of prophetic deeds sometimes receive considerable attention and some have been known to survive for centuries through oral tradition or as religious texts.

Prophecy is a prediction or the disclosure of information that is not known to the prophet by any ordinary means.
