## Constitutional Hermeneutic Principles and Constitutional Interpretation

* https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-31739-7_91-1

>Interpretation is a fact of law. It is thought that the law invites interpretation on the basis of a codification that has been established from a hierarchy of sources. Faced with a normative reality in which different reading criteria are established, hermeneutics appear as a tool at the service of the interpreter, so that the essential relevance that appears in order to establish the most appropriate interpretation can be established. The issue affects constitutional law, since many legal questions (laws, regulations, and sentences) end up being judged under the protection of constitutional interpretation. The constitution is thus presented as a hermeneutic criterion when evaluating legal work, since it is at the top of the pyramid of the sources of a stateâ€™s law. However, its legal preeminence leads to another preliminary question which is also hermeneutical in nature and which answers the question: What does the constitution mean and how should it be interpreted?


## Judicial interpretation

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_interpretation

>Judicial interpretation refers to different ways that the judiciary uses to interpret the law, particularly constitutional documents and legislation. This is an important issue in some common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, Australia and Canada, because the supreme courts of those nations can overturn laws made by their legislatures via a process called judicial review. This power creates the potential for the judiciary to be able to make law, and is why judicial interpretation is a significant issue.


### Originalism

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism

>Originalism is a method of constitutional and statutory interpretation. Originalists assert that legal text should be interpreted based on the original understanding at the time of adoption. Originalists object to the idea of the significant legal evolution being driven by judges in a common law framework and instead favor modifications of laws through the Legislature or through Constitutional amendment.
