# CDSP ~ Diaconal Hermeneutics ~ Welcome and who's here

Rod

Welcome to a seven week exploration of a diaconal hermeneutic. We are a small group so there will be less time than usual for the conversation portions of the course. That means we can say more and it will probably take less time--as you are planning how to work this all into your schedules.

The typical pattern will be an essay posted for each week, with several questions from me posed in response to it. There will always be an open-ended beginning for your questions and observations. All questions are important. That's how we learn from each other. From time to time I will post or refer you to an online source for additional readings. The only 'assigned' book is Walter Breuggemann's classic, The Prophetic Imagination. for this course, the work is best taken as a whole rather than linking  chapter to a specific week. Things will start off a bit light to give you time to get well into it. You can ask a question or make an observation any time. We will do some explicit work later in the course.

BUT, before all that, let's see who's here.
I am using a Moodle forum for this so I invite everyone to tell us all the following:

Who you are>
Where you reside and which diocese is that in.
Where you are on a spectrum of possible places in the world of diaconal formation--
Curions ~ Curious
In the process of discernment for Holy Orders
A nominee
A postulant
A candidate
A deacon (ordained when and where, and now serving where and with what foci in your ministry leadership)
A member of a Commission on Ministry
and of course, lest this seem exhaustive. 'Other"

Apart from taking role, my experience is that students in this course have found connection with prospective diaconal colleagues in dioceses other than their own.


## A basic question

How clear are you on the difference between exegesis and hermeneutic?  Have they showed up in other courses or learning events you have engaged?

* Ecclesiastical exegesis & hermeneutics versus legal exegesis & hermeneutics

## Why do you think ~ Should read, Another Question

Why do you think preaching "allegorically or mysticaly" would be grounds for flunking Homiletics in Bishop Knisley's seminary days?


## Theo

Who Are you?

I am Theo Armour.

Born in Boston MA in 1947. Lived ten years in both England and Hong Kong. Former registered architect, currently a software developer, actively delving into the realms of Artificial Intelligence. Publish the monthly newsletter for our community.

I love my three daughters, my family and a good number of other people.

Where you reside and which diocese is that in?

I reside in the Marina district of San Francisco, California, USA and therefore in the Episcopal Diocese of Northern California. My actual residence is in the same retirement community as our instructor, Rod Dugliss.

Where you are on a spectrum of possible places in the world of diaconal formation?

## Scripture is always interpreted

See Constitutional Hermeneutics

## Being intentional about our hermeneutic stances is an essential part of becoming mature Christian persons in our increasingly secularized environment.
Also

The telling of the who and why of our selves, or of others studied in our several environments will point to basic underlying meaning.

## Diaconal Hermeneutic

>I think my attempt to posit a diaconal hermeneutic is a modest exercise of the prophetic imagination.
>Hubris on my part, but it provides a framework that rescues the concept from being “just my idea.”

### Standing on the shoulders of giants

>The phrase "standing on the shoulders of giants" is a metaphor which means "using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have gone before in order to make intellectual progress".


## Eschatological hermeneutics

Certainly! Let's delve into the fascinating realm of **eschatological hermeneutics**.

**Hermeneutics** refers to the principles and methods used for interpreting Scripture. When it comes to **eschatology**, which deals with the study of end times and the fulfillment of biblical prophecies, our approach to interpretation becomes crucial.

Here are some key points related to eschatological hermeneutics:

1. **Consistently Literal Interpretation**:
   * We adhere to a hermeneutical system that interprets all Scripture using a consistently literal or normal method.
   * Our paradigm involves **grammatical, contextual, theological, and historical exegesis** to discern the **authorial intent** behind biblical texts.

2. **Dual Hermeneutics**:
   * We believe that the same hermeneutical principles should govern the interpretation of both the Old and New Testaments.
   * Rejecting any approach that treats Old Testament prophecies differently based on their subject matter (e.g., first advent vs. second advent).

3. **Typology**:
   * We recognize points of correspondence between the Old and New Testaments.
   * Some of us limit this correspondence to explicit textual correlations, while others see implicit correlations that enhance earlier revelation.

4. **Multiple Fulfillments**:
   * In our commitment to literal interpretation, we encounter New Testament passages where the connection to Old Testament antecedents isn't obvious.
   * Some passages imply fulfillments not explicitly found in the original prophecies. We view these as analogies or expansions of meaning.

5. **Dual Authorship**:
   * We acknowledge that biblical autographs involve at least two participants: a human agent and God.
   * Whether viewing this authorship as **unitary** (confluence of divine-human wording and meaning) or **binary** (cooperation with fuller divine meaning), we reject adding new meaning to Old Testament texts.

6. **Inaugurated Eschatology**:
   * We recognize that major eschatological prophecies to national Israel remain unfulfilled.
   * Rejecting any application of inaugurated eschatology that blurs the distinction between Israel and the church, we affirm the literal consummation of Old Testament promises and prophecies¹.

In summary, eschatological hermeneutics guides us in understanding the grand narrative of God's plan for humanity, from creation to ultimate fulfillment. 🌟📜
