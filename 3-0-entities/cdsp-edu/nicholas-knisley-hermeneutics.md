Knisley: When I was in seminary the idea of preaching an allegorical interpretation of a scriptural passage was viewed with extreme distaste. Like "fail the preaching course" distaste.

Rod asks:
Why do you think preaching "allegorically or mysticaly" would be grounds for flunking Homiletics in Bishop Knisley's seminary days?

Melissa. I agree that it's not easy - looking at Kinsley's one pager - to deduce why a literal or typological approach to homiletics was _de rigeur_ - required by etiquette or current fashion in the early nineties..

Nothing in the events of the time would suggest that a literal approach to scripture would be more appropriate than an allegorical one:

1991 ~ Gulf war ~ Collapse of USSR ~ Bush president ~ hip hop ~ WWW starts

But if - in this current era - if you are trying to entice a "a relatively young, bright congregation" to listen to your sermon, you might choose a allegorical/mystical approach over a literal one. Because it's currently all about influencers, marketing and fashion.
