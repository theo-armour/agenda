# Summary of Diaconal Hermeneutic Session Seven: The Diaconal Hermeneutic in Practice

**Introduction:**

- The session aims to provide a starting point for applying the diaconal hermeneutic in practice, recognizing the unique and contextual opportunities each deacon will encounter.

**Impact of COVID-19:**

- The pandemic has reshaped how the Episcopal Church operates, with new ways of being and doing church emerging, which deacons can significantly influence.

**Role of the Deacon:**

- Deacons interpret events and people’s pain for the church, focusing on invitation rather than declamation.
- The diaconal hermeneutic emphasizes a prophetic vocation that must be handled with care and subtlety.

**Key Strategies:**

- Engage the congregation using imaginative and poetic approaches, such as the “I wonder...” strategy from Godly Play.
- Help the congregation recognize and act on their baptismal promises.

**Challenges:**

- Deacons may face misunderstanding, political labeling, or being ignored.
- The diaconal hermeneutic is not a temporary trend but a deeply rooted theological and scriptural approach.

**Practical Examples:**

1. **Foster-Grandparent Program:** A deacon observed a need in a neighborhood school and initiated a foster-grandparent program to support latchkey kids.
2. **Prayers of the People:** During a special service, a deacon linked petitions to wider world issues, subtly incorporating diaconal perspectives into the liturgy.
3. **HUB Ministry:** Deacon Steven Bentley in Stockton, CA, created a ministry to support urban bicyclists and address food deserts, continually adapting to community needs.

**Preaching and Online Presence:**

- Deacons should leverage opportunities to preach and maintain an online presence to communicate the Gospel and encourage ministry engagement.
- Effective preaching should invite transformation and Gospel praxis, contrasting with typical sermons focused on personal spiritual growth or intellectual stimulation.

**Conclusion:**

- The diaconal hermeneutic calls for a prophetic imagination and active engagement in ministry.
- The course encourages ongoing discussion and application of these principles, with a final assignment to conclude.

**Final Note:**

- The course will remain open for further discussion, with a final assignment to be posted for continuing education or formation documentation.
