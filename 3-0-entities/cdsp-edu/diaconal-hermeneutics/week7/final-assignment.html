<h1>The Final Assignment</h1>
<p>As a lay person and a techie, I have been asked by Bishop Bishop to help the orders of ministers in our diocese to understand how they might use technology to help them in their ministries - starting with the diaconate.</p>
<p>An interesting way of getting going might be to help deacons with writing a psalm with the help of an artificial intelligence program.</p>
<p>Here are  links to some AI programs that might be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://copilot.microsoft.com/</li>
<li>https://gemini.google.com/</li>
<li>https://claude.ai/chats</li>
<li>https://chatgpt.com/</li>
</ul>
<p>For this exercises, I am using ChatGPT. Here is the prompt I developed for ChatGPT to help me with this exercise:</p>
<h2>Theo's Psalm Prompt for ChatGPT</h2>
<p><strong>Context:</strong>
You are a bishop in the American Episcopalian Church, a leader with great wisdom, kindness, and cleverness. The user is a newly ordained deacon in the Episcopal Church.</p>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong>
Generate three psalms, each tailored for three different congregations, in the tone, format, and style of the book of Jeremiah. Each psalm should incorporate the themes of kindness, thoughtfulness, and bearing the burdens of others, as reflected in the following prayer:</p>
<p>&quot;Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.&quot;</p>
<p>Each psalm should reflect the characteristics and needs of its intended congregation and be preceded by a description of its intended purpose and followed by comments on what has been left out. The tone should follow the thinking of Walter Brueggemann in his book &quot;Prophetic Imagination,&quot; adjusted for each congregation but maintaining a single authentic, trustable voice.</p>
<p>Each psalm should be aware of the calling of the deacon to be:</p>
<p>• Gospel based ~ of proclaiming—not just reading—the Gospel
• Prophet informed ~ the public interpretation of Scripture (not predicting the future)
• Baptismally realized ~ communal and inclusive nature of the Gospel’s call
• Systemic and critical ~ profound, critical analysis of social issues.
• Relational ~ community and collective responsibility
• Heart broken and compassionate ~ compassionate approach
• Real not theoretical ~  practical, real-world application</p>
<p><strong>Style and Tone:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For the prosperous, conservative, elderly congregation in a rural locale, speak to the leaders.</li>
<li>For the middle-class, progressive, middle-aged congregation in a suburban area, speak to the families.</li>
<li>For the working-class, populist, young congregation in an urban area, speak to the young.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Response Format:</strong>
Each psalm should be a reflection of the congregation it is intended for, written in a way that is accessible and meaningful to that congregation. Include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The title of the psalm</li>
<li>A description of the psalm's intended purpose.</li>
<li>The psalm itself along</li>
<li>Comments on what has been left out.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong>
Your task is to generate three psalms, each tailored to a specific congregation as described above. You MUST incorporate the themes of kindness, thoughtfulness, and bearing the burdens of others from the given prayer. The tone should follow Walter Brueggemann's &quot;Prophetic Imagination,&quot; adjusted for each congregation's unique characteristics but maintaining a single authentic, trustable voice. Think step by step and provide a detailed description, the psalm, and comments for each congregation.</p>

<p><strong>First Psalm: For a prosperous, conservative, elderly congregation in a rural locale</strong></p>
<p><em>Purpose:</em> This psalm is intended to speak to the leaders of a prosperous, conservative, elderly congregation. It is written in the tone, format, and style of the book of Jeremiah in the King James Bible.

<p><em>Title of the Psalm:</em> A Call to Righteous Leadership</p>
<p><em>Psalm:</em>
Thus saith the Lord unto the leaders of the land,
Hearken ye unto the words of wisdom and understanding.
For ye are blessed with abundance and peace,
Yet forget not the commandment to love thy neighbor.</p>
<p>In the days of plenty, remember the cries of the needy,
In the time of harvest, share with the hungry.
For the Lord seeth the heart and the deeds thereof,
And He delighteth in the merciful and just.</p>
<p>Be ye shepherds to the flock, not lords over them,
For the Lord of Hosts regardeth the humble.
Let kindness be your guide and thoughtfulness your path,
And bear ye the burdens of others with gladness.</p>
<p>Lo, the Lord shall bless the land that hearkeneth to His voice,
And He shall establish the work of your hands.
But woe unto those who turn a deaf ear,
For their days shall be filled with sorrow and strife.</p>
<p>Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel,
He who heareth and seeth all.
Lead with love, govern with grace,
And your days shall be lengthened in peace.</p>
<p><em>Comments:</em> The themes of political activism and social justice have been intentionally left out to maintain focus on personal piety and communal leadership. The psalm emphasizes stewardship, humility, and the moral duty of leaders, reflecting the congregation's conservative values.</p>

<p><em>Title of the Psalm:</em> A Vision of Compassionate Community</p>
<p><em>Psalm:</em>
Hear the word of the Lord, O people of the suburb,
Incline your ear to His teachings and walk in His ways.
For the Lord has planted you in fertile ground,
That you might grow in love and in service to one another.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the stranger in your midst,
Show hospitality to those in need.
For in welcoming the least of these,
You welcome the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>Let your homes be havens of kindness,
Your hearts fountains of thoughtfulness.
For the Lord rejoices in the fellowship of the righteous,
And He blesses those who care for their brethren.</p>
<p>In your work and in your play, remember the oppressed,
In your joy, be mindful of those who weep.
For the Lord is near to the brokenhearted,
And He saves the crushed in spirit.</p>
<p>Build a community of grace and compassion,
Where each one bears the burdens of others.
And the Lord will be your strength and your shield,
A present help in times of trouble.</p>
<p>Thus says the Lord, the God of all creation,
He who calls you by name and loves you eternally.
Walk in the light of His love,
And you shall dwell in His peace forever.</p>

<p><em>Title of the Psalm:</em> A Cry for Justice and Compassion</p>
<p><em>Psalm:</em>
Listen, O young people of the city,
Hear the voice of the Lord who calls you.
You who struggle and strive, do not lose heart,
For the Lord is with you in your trials.</p>
<p>Be kind to one another, tenderhearted,
Forgiving one another as the Lord forgave you.
In your battles, remember the weak,
In your victories, lift up the fallen.</p>
<p>Seek justice, love mercy, and walk humbly with your God,
For these are the ways of the righteous.
Let your compassion be as the morning dew,
Refreshing the weary and reviving the spirit.</p>
<p>Do not turn away from the cries of the oppressed,
For the Lord hears them and will not be silent.
Stand firm in the face of injustice,
And bear the burdens of your brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>The Lord is your refuge and your strength,
A stronghold in times of trouble.
Trust in Him and He will guide your steps,
And you will be a light in the darkness.</p>
<p>Thus declares the Lord, the Defender of the weak,
He who fights for the downtrodden and lifts up the humble.
Be courageous and steadfast,
And His peace will be with you always.</p>
<p><em>Comments:</em> The themes of material wealth and traditional hierarchical structures have been intentionally left out. The psalm emphasizes resilience, solidarity, and the practical application of faith in daily struggles, resonating with the youthful, working-class, urban congregation.</p>
<h2>My Thoughts</h2>
<p>I am conflicted.</p>
<p>Each of the three psalms reads as if the words could have come from &quot;Up Above&quot;. It depends on which cloud we are talking about. <img class="emoji" alt="wink"

<p>I can see the efforts in two ways:</p>
<p>They may be seen as the collected wisdom of millennia.</p>
<p>They may be seen blasphemous imitations.</p>
<p>My hope is that you use these tools as they are intended - as devices to chat with. The prompt I used above was evolved by chatting with ChatGPT until we had a text that covered the bases I wanted to cover.</p>
<p>In the real world, I would create a number of examples, then use these as a starting point for writing my own psalm - while at the same time asking ChatGPT for feedback on my work.</p>
