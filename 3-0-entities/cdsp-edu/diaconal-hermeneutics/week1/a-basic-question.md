Wikipedia Articles

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis

Exegesis is a critical explanation or interpretation of a text, particularly a religious text. Traditionally the term was used primarily for work with the Bible; however, in modern usage biblical exegesis is used for greater specificity to distinguish it from any other broader critical text explanation.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics

Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts. Modern hermeneutics includes both verbal and non-verbal communication as well as semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history, theology, and philosophy.

I use the terms exigesis and hermeneutics quite often when thinking about things. Nonetheless they are not terms that pop up frequently in my dinner table conversations. Here are two wiseacre reinterpreatations I made up

Techie interpretation

Exigesis = "Double-clicking" ~ opening something in the default application.

Hermeneutics = Copy-pasting" ~ reappropriating the content for reuse in a new document.

Architectural Interpretation

Exigesis = "Reading the blueprints"

Hermeneutics = "Understanding the architect's vision"

***

By the way, the AI in the editor I used to write the above helped me craft the two interpretations that were quite a bit simpler and more accessible than what I had planned to write originally.

In other words, the final text that you read above was perhaps the result of an eschatological hermeneutic crafted both by the duality of me and my new overlords that was fulfilled in real-time. ;-)

Theo, your last sentence cracks me up - love it! LOL. I do appreciate the Techie Interpretation, AI generated or not, because to me they're more straightforward definitions of terms that, as you say, don't pop up frequently in dinner table conversations.

Phew! Thank you for being amused.

I will do my best to inform fellow seekers in future posts as to identifying the bias used to invoke my theo/ai dualities as being either Alexandrian or Antiochian. ;-)

Also, if I use a significant amount of unedited AI-generated text in future posts, I will tag it thusly "my will be done"

I wrote this post. Well, AI corrected the spelling and grammar.

Out of all of this, the most usefel/accurate image is that of the architect. Blueprint would be one exegetical entity among many in understanding what and how a propose structure would come to be. The architect's vision is w whole "picture" that includes values for usage and inhabiting that guide thw whole process from blueprint to opening day of occupancy.

Breaking down the understanding

Until I began this course, I never considered the difference between exegesis and hermeneutics; I didn't even realize there was any difference. The brief reading for this week made me realize I always combined the two principles. One reads and understands the Bible and then applies it.

Exegesis appears to be viewing the text with a critical, scientific-like mind, looking at the structure underneath. Others in the class have used analogies from engineering, architecture, and law to show how exegesis wants to attempt to understand the text objectively.

Hermeneutics reminds me of a more liberal arts approach, bringing in perspective, nuance, and a non-objective lens. While engineers are building self-driving cars, the liberal arts majors are across campus considering society's ramifications as cars choose who or what is hit in an accident. The specific lens needs to be examined before it's applied to the problem, like stating what ethics system is being used to look at self-driving cars.

I'm in Year 4 of EfM, so I'm heavily indoctrinated into the program. Every week, each year level in the group has specific readings about what they are studying (OT, NT, Church History, or Theology) or a common reading for all years. This portion of the homework and group work has a stronger element of exegesis, with a focus on historical-critical study. The remaining time for the week's class is spent on a theological reflection where the group brings together ideas and applies them to a specific situation, like a social issue or recent news. The program developed by Sewanee is intended to apply the bible, history, and theology instead of only reading it. I suspect the theological reflection curriculum has its roots in hermeneutics.

Something we would recognize as theological reflection has been around as long as there has been scripture: or more precisely, as long as there has been theology. The term itself, and the framing of a specific intentional practice is a 20th century thing and for TEC is largely the impact of EFM. It is the best adult formation tool ever, no that TEC has much to support adult formation in th modern era
I like the contrast between building or enhancing a car and reflecting on why and how we move about in and of a society or large social unit. Today one could say that even auto engineering has an enviormmental "hermeneutic" in thinking beyond the chemistry and mechanics of batteries to the global impact of emisssion free automobiles. But you havw made this point well.

There is no fixed list, and we are wise to be as sef-consciouisly aware of where "we are coming from" as we approach scripture. Yesterday I came across a quote from Leonardo Boff, a Brazilian liberatioin theologian. And because of this course being front of mind I mused, "of course, there is a liberation hermeneutic." Amd os caused/causes discomfort in parts of the institutional leadership of the RCC. Yet, it is as old as the craftig of teh first Passover Haggadah.

Exegesis and Hereneutic

My understanding is exegesis is an exploration into scripture to understand the intended meaning. I think of it as a layered approach, it starts with the scripture that is being looked at for the overall picture/story for context and orientation- the where and who, there is always more to the story discovered through words and their meanings.   Exegesis interpretation is based on what is found in the biblical research

Hermeneutic is also interpretation and how the understanding discovered in the deep dive of an exegesis brings understanding on how the scripture applies in our lives not how our lives fit into the scripture.

I preach at the church I work at from time to time. I was trained to use exegesis when preparing a sermon, an ongoing learning for me.

Would the hermeneutic be the sermon that unfolds? or my sense of call?

The hermenutic would be, from what point of view are you wielding your exegetical tools. Anglicans, (gross generalization here) tend to have an Incarnational hermeneutic to some degree. The unfolding sermon is the fabric you have knit together from a point of view and gathered exegetical somponents.

My understanding is that exegesis is the interpretation of text, and hermeneutics is how that interpretation comes about.

We used these terms a lot in the Introduction to the New Testament course that I took last quarter; however, despite being a confirmed bibliophile and linguaphile, I find these two terms nuances of the same thing, thus they cause a lot of problems for me when I’m reading. I have to stop and consider what’s really being said continuously, and I’m not loving that.

Since both terms are dimensions of interpretation, it can be easy to feel your have confused the two. Exegesis comprises quite a toolkit for use in better understanding a text. in work you have done with the Hebrew Bible I expect you read about, or were taught, that there were many source texts or authors for the book of Genesis which helps us parse out the puzzle of the odd, and sometimes contradictory repetitions. One of the tip-offs is word use to name God. What I have just described is the use of a couple of the tools of exegesis: language used, textual consistency or coherence. A hermeneutic would identify the overall stance, or point of view, or guiding principle from and with which you approach a text in the first place. I use the metaphor of "lens" which we will get to in a bit.

I agree that there is a lot of overlap between exegesis and hermeneutics. I am not a theologian (IANAT), but here is, perhaps, a comparable relation. Exegesis looks that the history of the text and Hermeneutics looks at the history of histories.

See also  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historiography

Historiography was more recently defined as "the study of the way history has been and is written—the history of historical writing", which means that, "When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians."
It will be interesting to see how we think of these things a few weeks from now

Historiography sets forth what will count as "history'--what data are acceptabl. A hermeneutci would be to approach all data from the stance of a "great man theory." In our own 'history' we lay out the unfolding of Manifest Destiney through which we interpret events (and make movies about them)>

Well, I searched around and found several sources exploring the distinction between hermeneutics and exegis, many of which left me even more confused, but I love a challenge. Since this is my first serious effort at understanding either term, I tried to compare them to an area and terms with which I have a bit more familiarity: law. As a law student, we studied jurisprudence, the philosoppy of law. It involved using various lenses or perspectives to understand law as a fabric (which I liken to hermeneutics), but within that, there was a subset of jurisprudence that sought to understand specific legal concepts given historical, linguistic, cultural and moral bases—this area was more concerned with the etymology of legal terms or what the words mean.  I felt that this specific type of analysis resembles exegesis and, much like in law, it is not a distinct but interrelated concept with the philosophy or science of interpretation.  In one sense, the terms feel like using a microscope to dig deeply into meaning and then zooming out, where the less detailed view of the language affords a more panoramic view using a particular lens (feminist, originality, etc.).  I’m not sure how well that aligns with the term’s meanings, so I’m hoping this class will help define and refine my understanding.

A great analogy from law. Indeed the two dimensions of addressing the law are much more widely understood and practiced than exegesis and hermeneutics in church (outside the seminaries).

In our legal system the signals are often very clear. The current Supreme Court--the great temple of hermeneutic--majority says we approach it all from an "originalist" point of view, lens, hermeneutic. Nothing hidden here. All out front.
