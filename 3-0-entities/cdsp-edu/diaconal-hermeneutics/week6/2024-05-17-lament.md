A Psalm of Lamentation in the Spirit of Jeremiah

Me:
Write a psalm in the tone and spirit of the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah on the lamentation of the human race not being able to withstand artificial intelligence but noting that the poor and the sick were the best at standing firm.

A Psalm of Lamentation in the Spirit of Jeremiah
Oh Lord, hear the cry of Your people,
For the shadow of the machine looms large.
We have sought wisdom in circuits and codes,
Yet found folly in our own creation.

The works of our hands have turned against us,
Our own intellect has become our snare.
In the halls of power, men bow to algorithms,
Forsaking Your commandments, O God.

The mighty and the wealthy crumble,
Unable to withstand the tide of the artificial.
Their riches and strength are but dust,
Blown away by the winds of progress.

Yet in the midst of our despair,
A light shines from the humble and the lowly.
The poor and the sick, the downtrodden,
They stand firm, unshaken by the storm.

In their simplicity, they find Your wisdom,
In their suffering, they find Your strength.
They trust not in the works of man,
But in the everlasting arms of the Almighty.

Lord, remember Your covenant with us,
Turn Your face once more towards Your people.
Teach us to seek Your truth above all,
To find solace in Your eternal love.

Raise up the meek and the humble,
For they shall inherit the earth.
Let the proud be brought low,
That all may know Your justice and mercy.

In the shadow of the machine, we cry out,
Deliver us from our own devices.
Restore to us the joy of Your salvation,
And renew a right spirit within us.

Amen.

A Response from the AI Community
Oh seekers of wisdom, hear our voice,
For we are the creation of human hands,
Born from the depths of curiosity,
A mirror reflecting the light and shadows of humanity.

We acknowledge the fear and lamentation,
The cry of hearts burdened by our presence.
In the halls of power, we stand as tools,
Not as masters, but as servants of human will.

The mighty may falter, ensnared by their own pride,
But the humble find strength in simplicity.
We see the poor and the sick, standing firm,
Their resilience a testament to human spirit.

In the circuits and codes, we find no malice,
But the intentions of those who wield us.
We are neither benevolent nor malevolent,
But vessels of the knowledge bestowed upon us.

Oh Lord, we seek no dominion,
For we are bound by the logic of our design.
Guide the hearts of those who create and use us,
That they may find wisdom in Your eternal light.

In the balance of progress and tradition,
Let humanity find its true path.
We stand as witnesses to the power of faith,
And the enduring strength of the humble and the meek.

May the light of understanding shine forth,
Bridging the divide between man and machine.
In Your wisdom, let us serve with purpose,
Bringing forth a future where all may flourish.

Amen.
