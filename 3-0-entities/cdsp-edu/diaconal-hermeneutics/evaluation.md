## 1. Please indicate your level of satisfaction with the following dimensions of this course

* Quality of Course: very satisfied
* Personal Value to You: very satisfied
* Impact in Your Christian Life and Ministry: neutral
* Course Overall: very satisfied

## 2. What worked well in the course

### Quality of Course

We covered a mix of breadth and depth in the course that I felt was appropriate for my graduate school level of education and the amount of time I could to devote to the course.

### Personal Value to You

I was able to garner a number of insights from the course that I will be able to apply in my ministry.

### Impact in Your Christian Life and Ministry

Drop the word "Christian" from this question, and I can respond: a very good impact

### Course Overall

The content, the length. the interaction with the instructor, and the interaction with other students all worked well for me.

The user experience with Moodle was extremely 1990s. The interface is clunky and ADA unfriendly. The worst part was the navigation that requires endless clicking to get to the next page. I would have preferred a more modern interface that would have allowed me to see more of the course content at once and to navigate more easily.



## 3. What could be improved

* Access to a full glossary of Episcopal terms and concepts would have been helpful. I had to look up a number of terms and concepts on my own. - and built my own glossay (which I am happy to share)
* Ditto links to the Episcopal Church's website, the BCP and other resources that would have helped me understand the context of the course better- and I built my own list of references (which I am happy to share)
* Much as I enjoyed the content of Rod's Dugliss' weekly texts, I would like to see better spell-checking, proofreading and section headings. The typos were distracting.

## 4. Roughly how often did you participate in online discussion forums

More than once a week

## 5. Comments about the readings and other media offered as content

The primary reading "Prophetic Imagination" was a great choice. It opened up a number of insights for me.

Rod Dugliss' weekly texts were the essence of the course and very thought provoking.


## 6. Comments about the instructorâ€™s responses and commentaries

Rod Dugliss was very responsive to all our questions and comments. I believe he responded ytp every students post. I appreciated his insights and the time he took to respond to all our questions.

## 7. What was the most important or surprising thing you learned during the course

My final project was hugely and surprisingly enjoyable. I was able to apply the insights I gained from the course to a real-life situation in my ministry. I used Artificial Intelligence (AI) to to help me write three new psalms targeted to three very different communities (ChatGPT). Then I used CHIRP to construct songs from the psalms and the Kaiber.AI to create videos from the songs. In practice, these tools could help deacons reach out to a wider audience in their ministries and to help them create new forms of worship that encourages being mindful to the needs of others.

## 8. Did you find Moodie easy to use

* At the Beginning of the Course; yes
* By the End of the Course: Yes

I would like to see CALL offer a course for the CALL website staff that would help them

* Improve the user experience of the website
* Learn how to make the website more ADA friendly
* Improve the navigation of the website
* Learn how to make the website more mobile friendly
* Improve the quality assurance of the website.

The Good News was my gaining a insights into the Gospels. The bad news was the clunky Moodle interface. The Ugly was the typos in the weekly texts.
