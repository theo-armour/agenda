From the ages of 12 to 18 I attended a New England Episcopalian boarding school that was considered elite. One might say that it was a modern day equivalent of Walter Breuggemann's "Royal Consciousness." Nonetheless the school prayer asked:

>Grant, O Lord, that in all the joys of life we may never forget to be kind. Help us to be unselfish in friendship, thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves, and eager to bear the burdens of others; through Jesus Christ our Savior. Amen.

In the midst of plenty there was a reminder that others had less. Unfortunately, in that place and era, there was almost nothing I (we) could do (or was advised to do) to bear the burdens of others.

Now that I an 77. I live in a retirement community and have no (few) worries about my growing old.

To be frank and practical: nowadays almost all I can do is be merely thoughtful of those less happy than ourselves. Few if any actions are doable by me actually to bear the burdens of others.

What can a deacon in the Episcopal Church do to help people such as me to imagine and act on bearing the burdens of others?

Or are we stuck with merely dealing with "all the joys of life" and not forgetting to be kind?
