Here is a link to a video to the psalm: "A Cry for Justice"

The psalm was written for a radical urban audience

By mistake, I seem to have used the same soundtrack for a video intended for a rural and conservative audience

Link: "A Call to Righteous Leadership"

Correct images - in the style of Grant Wood/American Gothic and text to first psalm but incorrect soundtrack.

You may have to open the links in a new tab.

Rats. It looks like Moodle gets muddled. The links in my previous reply generated videos that worked here in Moodle when I edited them but have since stopped displaying.

For the rural, conservative congregation: A Call to Righteous Leadership
You will see a lot of bears in this video. The word "bear" is in the psalm. ;-)

All these need a way of displaying the text of the psalm as it is being sung. My guess is that I can get this to happen when I upload the videos to YouTube.

What have I learned?
I can use AI to create a psalm that reads and sounds OK. I think I can write better psalms. I would not have known this without seeing AI's examples.

AI is good at giving feedback. So, when I do write a psalm, AI can be my editor.

I am not a musician or animator. I therefore would rely on AI for music and videos. There might be somebody in the diocese who could help.

What is a vision, a prophetic imagination?
I can see establishing a process whereby psalms are written by an AI human pertnership on a regular basis for the website or newsletter of a congregation. The psalms reveal the gospels in ways that are topical, relavant and meaningful to a particilar congregation.

The practice might extend out to prayers and hymns. With all these media, AI can serve as remedies for the blank piece of paper dilemnma and coaches and critics as time goes on.

Let the Good News enthrall people in nice new ways!
