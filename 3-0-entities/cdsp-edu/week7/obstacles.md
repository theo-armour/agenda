# 2024-05-22 Obstacles

Obstacles are interesting things.

An obstacle can be a pointing the way toward seeing what is wrong with something. If you remove it, then your way is clear to proceed.

But an obstacle can also be a pointing to the wrong thing - a warning sign to something to be avoided. "Here be dragons" as the old maps used to say.

Be careful in choosing yor obstacles

Henry Ford’s quote: “If I had asked my customers what they wanted they would have said a faster horse” springs to mind"

Ditto the serenity prayer: “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
