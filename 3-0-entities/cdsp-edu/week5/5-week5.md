So I read Bruckman chapter three and 4. And boy, do I have a lot of differences. Brookman talks about grief As an all encompassing. Very difficult hard thing. To go through And he contrasts that against the Numbness. Of people subjugated by the royal consciousness So he's saying that real people should. wear hair shirts and get all upset when people die As far as I could see, you know, I wish I would learn more. and he's talking reference to Jeremiah and and and bits that I haven't read yet. I've been through, I don't know, maybe 20 deaths here And numbness is what I feel or It's just this is another passing. This is this is life now.

Is it numbness or is it something else but they've they've gone to dust and we have to accept that and and get on with it. Yes, this grief or the guess that I missed the person. I enjoyed them. They were nice. They liked me. I liked them. I think of Aggie or Marian Peterson And we'd we'd cut to know each other. We helped each other. We did things, and now they're gone. And so be it. I hope that when I go, it's kind of the same thing. Yes, it might be a celebration of life, but some people won't have one. It seems like he gets, you know, you must get all turmoil in, but, you know, bubble bubble toying trouble. No, that's not the right thing. But we you kind of get all excited about somebody's death. II don't buy it. So that was certainly one aspect of Brugman.

The other one is I'm trying to find amazing and new language and things like that. There was some other aspect that he talked about that I wasn't sure but we will go back and and and work on this. Apart from that, how was the day we. Let's see. We had the The NUC the my computer's microphone started working again because there was an update of the drivers. So that is automatically happened. And so I didn't really need to buy AA new microphone, but at least now I have a microphone. Oh, interesting What I'm doing now is actually my audio phone speech Isn't it So maybe I should continue this. But it's not doing a good job of summarizing. It's doing putting down almost exactly what I say. But this should be about fragment, so I will stop here and then move over to audio But yes, Google Google chat bot thing talk thing is doing very well.
