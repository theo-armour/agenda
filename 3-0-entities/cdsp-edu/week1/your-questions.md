In studying church history I appreciate the change to the creed after the first Council of Constantiople to reflect the deity of the Holy Spirit. The original writing seemed interested in focusing on Jesus not the three persons in one. The creed encapsulates the triune God and what we believe. My understanding is: We believe in one God (God who created life and all things); We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ (Jesus is this life of all things that God created) We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life ( the holy spirit is the fire of life , that spirit and energy within us.) As deacons, living the creed encompasses all of this, the sacred scriptures of the Old Testament from God, the teachings of Jesus in the new testament and the understanding of his ministry, life and death and the holy spirit, the fire of life -the energy and spirit of call. Simplistic? Maybe. Powerful and relatable. This goes back to the second paragraph stating "there are several ways to posit and understand church." As deacons if we don't do that we will not be able to relate to, teach, and meet people where they are.

The years of history and rewriting of the Creed echo voices of the past collectively bring it to life when said in community. It's like creating gold from straw, affirming our faith with the faith of others present and from centuries past, a joining of the ancient and modern.

I tend to be of both worlds the ancient and modern. Let me explain. I value and love tradition AND feel very called to think out of the box weaving tradition and the modern world together. The words , "being in communion with God, with ourselves, with others and with the world", speak to me. It's relational. Relationship with God and with one another.

It seems there has always been power shifts as the church evolved that continue today as we are called to new ways of being church due to ongoing decline in participation and connections.

Christianity has used the three legged stool (scripture, reason and tradition) in discussing and explaining theological questions. Each is necessary and equally important to counter balance the other two. The church lived into this during the pandemic. It didn't alter Episcopal eccesiology . The core theology was there, this was  a reasonable approach during a crisis and being church in a different way.

Lots to continue pondering here.

I wonder if we should be spending more time on the Latin influences to translation before the reformation.

Jerome did an enormous thing. He crafted a single text, drawing on a lot (but not everything) that was available in the difuse Christian wrld. He also did what is still an "issue" in some quarters, he rendered the tet in "the language of the people." That was Latin (at least for those Christians within the Roman Empire) and the popular or "vulgar" variant was used. Hence to this day known as The Vulgate verson. Once that was esdtablished as the official Bible, much of the interpretive work rooted in language and usage faded well into the background. Since Latin is still an official language of the Roman Catholic Church and of the city-state of the Vatican, there are Latin linguists who work constantly to figure out how to express a papal proclamation on a very 21st century subject into the laanguaage used by Jerome.

What the bibilical folk in reformation times and today look for first is what is saaid in Greek in the fragments of scroll etc. that now comprise source documents. A huge shift came last century when the both the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Nag Hamdi Library were found. A trove of material in local languages much closed to the source historically than Jerome.

The ongoing enterprise is to capture original meaning (in its context) in contemporary language and context. I this midst of this, the work of the Latinists in the Vatican is a form of reverse engineering: prodigious but not very helpful.
