# Hi Dan

Hi Dan

I reached out to Karen McNeill. She is happy to have a chat.

I found this article about Karen. She has good vision.

I will put both of you in touch, but it would be a good thing to have a vision that entices her.

The current implementation of the Sensay.io website is not targeted toward the family history market. Do you have anything I can share with Karen that might whet her appetite?

Secondarily, I also have some ideas about boomer market opportunities. I started writing these up, but of course, this took a lot of time and I have not finished. I hope that by looking at your thoughts I can align mine with yours and speed things up.

I hope you are well and are keeping things sizzling!

Cheers,

Theo
