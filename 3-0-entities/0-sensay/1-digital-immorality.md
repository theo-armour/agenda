## What Color is Your ~~Parachute~~ Immortality?

## 2024-07-15 Preface

I'm just jumping here. I have not yet acquired an overall map or picture of of the landscape of the world of Sensay. Please let me know if any of the following "belongs" somewhere. Once I understand the landscape of how the mind of the replica is going to be build, stored and updated I will adapt these thoughts to suit the terrain.

The following thoughts are not yet fully baked. If you find any to be of interest, please let me know and I will try to develop them further.

Also, if any do become "badges of honor" in a gamification process, as I hope some will, I will be pleased to collaborate with community managers in monitoring and responding to user communications.

## Introduction

I am no psychologist, but I guess would a psychologist would concur with the idea that people have multiple facets or sides to their personalities, endeavors and dreams. Many of these aspects have elements that might be logged and are replicable.

Currently, I am thinking of three lenses or hermeneutics that might be used to build up the psychology of a replica.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutics

The fist might include Big 5 personality traits, political compass, social network activity and other psychological and anthropological aspects of a person.

Another way lens for building up the psychology of a replica might be aspects of attire, milieu and ephemera.

something like film or book genres, are there aspects of a film noir, or sitcom or a romance that could be used to build a replica of a person.

A third lens might be more like a tone or a color, are there aspects of a person that are more like a color or a tone that could be used to build a replica of a person. These aspects might be derived from aspects such as favrite songs, book they like, or the way they dress.

In the long term all of these aspects become useful and productive in building an authentic and useful replica of a person.

But what about in the short term right here in the middle of 2024?

## Rewarding Results

My guess is that some of the following topics could be used to create the basis of a fun way of entering data in the system that also helps you gain a badge or earn game points.

I could see some of the items being to create multiple choice quizzes

When you take a well structured quiz you receive insight and feedback about yourself. We should look for quizzes where we can obtain the results and insights and use them as a basis for creating a replica of a person.

## Chatbot by Chatbot

The thrust of this paper is that the replica of a person is not built by a single chatbot but a collection of chatbots. Each chatbot handles an aspect a replica of a person in a particular context.

The chatbots are not just a collection of chatbots but a collection of chatbots that are aware of each other and can interact with each other.


## Assumptions

At no time does Sensay ask for data that Sensay cannot keep and protect up to the level of the source of the data.. In other words any medical data should be protect up to HIPPAA, GDPR, PIPL standards. Any Banking data should be up to PCI DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, SWIFT CSP standards. So it take a while before Sensay can accept data from such sources. We must be careful about asking for such data until we can protect it from access by naughty people

You should be able to download your data and be able to delete your data at any time.

## Document Structure

This document is a first attempt to identify some of the many possible replicas of a person.

There are three sections to this document.

* The first section is a list of possible replicas templates for persona.
* The second section is a list of possible appearances, attire or accouterments for replicas.
* The third section is a list of possible "tones" for replicas.

The items ae in alphabetical order and are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive.

Where possible items include some of the data sources that might be used to create them. These in turn could lead to partnerships with companies that have access to such data.

Perhaps one could say the first section is the HTML, the second is the JavaScript and the third section is the CSS.


## 1. Replica Personas

Replicas will have a certain form, template, boilerplate. or tradition. This section begins to delineate some of the possible templates for replicas -
