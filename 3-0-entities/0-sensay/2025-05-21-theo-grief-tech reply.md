## First impressions

Given the name and what I see on "Forget Mer Not"

* The target audience (client) is is a son or daughter or a very close relative or friend of a special person 
* Given the name "Grief Tech" the special person (subject) has recently died or is about to die.

## Observations

* In coming to the site after the death and yet seeking to recreate the special person, tells me that a digital twin (replica) has not yet been created.
* It is also possible that the client the idea of creating a replica is a new idea or concept in the mind of the client.
* It indicates to ne that the client has not yet thought about the implications of creating a digital replica of the subject.

## The Problem

* The client has relied on a dialog with the subject in order to make life decisions.
* The client is missing that support and grieving over the loss of that support.
* The client is having difficulty making decisions without the support of the subject.


## Background

* The client is likely to seeking the "who, what, when, where, how and why" of creating a replica of the subject.
* And in doing so the client is also seeking to identify the benefits of having and communicating with a replica.

## The Solution: Grief Tech

* A valuable solution is to create a replica of the subject.
* The quality of the replica will be determined by the quality of the data that is used to create the replica.
* Data can be collected from a variety of available sources including:
* AI can speed up, simplify, and reduce the cost of the process of creating a replica.
* The process of creating a replica can be instrumental in progressing  grieving transitions process.
