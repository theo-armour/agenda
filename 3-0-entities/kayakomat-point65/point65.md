Hi Richard

Lots of questions.

1. If I understand things correctly, the shares will be new shares to be added to the current shares. Therefore existing shareholders will be diluted unless they buy in. Correct?

2. If we do buy in, the cost would be in the region of 350,000 SEK / US $33,000?

3. If we do buy in, can I send the funds, and only my three daughters receive the new shares?

4. If we do buy in, will you promise to deliver copies of the annual audit (in Swedish is OK) to shareholders?

5. If we do buy in, will you promise to provide shareholders with a quarterly narrative on the current status of the business?

6. If we do buy in, will this in any way further complicate matters for managing the owners of the company?

7. If we do buy in, will our new investment in any way serve to bring extra confidence or security to the company? In other words, will it be helpful to you or not really?
