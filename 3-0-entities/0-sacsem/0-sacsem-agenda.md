Hi Ron and Mike
Sam's is just as tasty and friendly as ever! Yay!

Our dialog was wonderful. I felt we could have continued for hours. Many thanks to both of you!

Some takeaways:

* What is a proper mission for SacSem in this era with this age group?
* Be mindful that attracting good engaged speakers and a an active membership are two separate aspects
* We represent a mixture of institutional and instrumental personas ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Edwin_AyresThere are opportunities for remixing the SacSem formula ~ North Beach Restaurant ~ meet twice a month ~ meet for dinners
* Perhaps seeking out younger staff to elected officials might be invigorating

A further thought after my nap:

Much of my career was built upon dealing with people much younger than me ~ which helped keep me young and was fun, but that was the past,

The interesting new career possibility is dealing with people older than me/us. What can be done to help older people maintain and develop their agency, usefulness and available wisdom?  In that sense, SacSem could be a useful venue to explore.

Update: Friday, January 17 at Perry's on Union: Kim Tavaglione, Executive Director of the San Francisco Labor Council

Kim Tavaglione, Executive Director of the San Francisco Labor Council is SacSem's guest for this Friday, January 17. She will be introduced by Seminarian Susan Horsfall.

Tavaglione was named Executive Director in November 2020. She is the first woman, and first woman of color, to lead the Council in its more than 125-year history.

Tavaglione joined the staff as Campaign Director in September of 2018 after serving as an Executive Committee member for nearly a decade. Tavaglione rebuilt a successful Labor-Neighbor program, resulting in electoral successes and increased civic engagement among union workers. She directed the issues and independent expenditure political programs, and led key strategic campaigns for the SFLC. Prior to her work at the Council, she served as a community and political director for the National Union of Healthcare Workers.
As Executive Director, Tavaglione leads the staff team to assist affiliate unions with political mobilization, contract campaigns, and strategic organizing."
Perhaps the headline for the update to members is something like "Organized Labor Under a Second Trump Administartion"?

She will be introduced by Seminarian Susan Horsfall.

Friday, January 17 at Perry's on Union: Roundtable "Your predictions for next week?"; John W. Busterud has requested a raincheck

This Friday, January 17 a clairvoyant roundtable: Your predictions for next week led by co-vice chair Linda Muir. You will look into your crystal ball and reveal how the Federal cabinet will shape up, soothsay the executive orders that will be signed and divulge the ways that the Los Angeles fires continue to cause turmoil.
