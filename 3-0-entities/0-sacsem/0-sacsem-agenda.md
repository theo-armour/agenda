Friday, January 17 at Perry on Union: Roundtable "Your predictions for next week?"; John W. Busterud has requested a raincheck

This Friday, January 17 a clairvoyant roundtable: Your predictions for next week led by co-vice chair Linda Muir. You will look into your crystal ball and reveal how the Federal cabinet will shape up, soothsay the executive orders that will be signed and divulge the ways that the Los Angeles fires continue to cause turmoil.

Hi Mark

May I invite you and Nancy to lunch with Marty and me at our house?

How about next week? Monday or Tuesday or Thursday? Around noon?

3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco CA 94123. Sadly no onsite parking.

Cheers,

Theo
