Hi Dennis

I shall return this Friday. 

Presentations
I will try again to project the presentation. Fingers crossed: it works.

Relying on the North Beach Restaurant (NBR) admin WiFi connection was a mistake. Their security kicked in and the connection from computer to projector was locked out. This time: old-school, everything by cable.

Presentation Management
Relying on people like me is not good practice. Any facility we use must be in charge of their own AudioVisual setup. Fifty inch TVs are a few hundred dollars. Who do I go to in SacSem in order to get the ball rolling? I have the email address of NBR's owner.

Seating
The current U-shape table configuration is a problem waiting to happen. The seats are close together. The seating points toward speedy virus transmissions and people falling when going to pee.

The U-shape also means you only talk to the two people next to you. Small, scattered tables enable easy conversation among five or more people.

Website, Online Payments and so forth
https://sacsem.net still links to PayPal. We should think about updating this and updating the site, including dropping departed people. Who can we muster up to consider things like this?

Cheers,

Theo

Hello Front Office, Patti and Cortez

This is to let you know that there a reception is planned for Marty Nolan on Wednesday October 23 at 3pm in Morgan Parlor. A number of visitors are expected. All residents and staff are invited. I am helping with the organization of the event.

Angie and Dining Services will be providing refreshments and snacks. A Dining Services server will help with the refreshments.

Mary has also been briefed.

Please help us with organization and set up for seating and microphone. The layout should be similar to the one used for Celebrations of Life.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Theo
