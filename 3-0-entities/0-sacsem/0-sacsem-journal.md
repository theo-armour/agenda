## 2024-09-26 Front Office

Hello Front Office, Patti and Cortez

This is to let you know that there a reception is planned for Marty Nolan on Wednesday October 23 at 3pm in Morgan Parlor. A number of visitors are expected. All residents and staff are invited. I am helping with the organization of the event.

Angie and Dining Services will be providing refreshments and snacks. A Dining Services server will help with the refreshments.

Mary has also been briefed.

Please help us with organization and set up for seating and microphone. The layout should be similar to the one used for Celebrations of Life.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers,

Theo
