From Jeff Russell


57 years friend of Jon.
We both shared at our core the best of the 60s insights.

I embodied that even later in life coming back to being a Yoga teacher

Before Jon made his mark here in San Francisco, he was a character and a significant presence in our large counter-cultural family at Syracuse University.

Jon touched a lot of lives. Over all the years, he kept in touch with many of us.

He would reminisce at the drop of a hat.

Jon affectionately called many of us the “Psychedelic Rangers.”

I’d like to name a few of us who are today weighing in: Dennis. Jeff. Vivian. Deborah D., Fred. Dan W., Joseph., Jon M. Steven. Beth. Dave and Tina. Bonnie. Don D. Bill. Chris. Deborah B., Kathy...and many others.

Jon’s passing marks a tear in the Force.

We grieve with you.
