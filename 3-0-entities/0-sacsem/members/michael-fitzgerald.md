Thank you for the kind words and offer of assistance. Today I tried to get the pipeline of speakers jumpstarted by sending invitations to Ayaan Hirsi Ali (Hoover Institution), Arlie Hochschild (UC Berkeley), and to Jon Steinberg (Editor-in-Chief of the SF Standard). I also have Susan Horsfall following up on my invitation to Kim Tavaglione on the Labor Council.

In terms of The Heritage, I would suggest contacting Richard Johns on the SF Historical Society’s board of directors because, in addition to his role on the board, he has served on the SF Historic Preservation Commission. Rich is a good guy and is very well-connected. The other thought is to contact Aaron Peskin to see if he might sponsor a designation as a “lame duck” on the Board of Supervisors.

## Standard Letter

Dear Ms. Tavaglione,

By way of introduction, I am the Program Chair of the Sacramento Seminar (www.sacsem.net), a bi-partisan luncheon group founded by members of the California legislature in 1983 to discuss civic and public affairs in an off-the-record setting. Speakers in the past have included Willie Brown, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and Mitt Romney. Current membership includes elected and appointed members of state, county and municipal governments, as well as individuals involved in politics on both sides of the political aisle.

I think you would be a compelling speaker to discuss organized labor's perspectives on the upcoming elections and I would like to extend an invitation for you to address the membership.

The Sacramento Seminar meets in San Francisco each Friday at Perry's Restaurant (1944 Union Street) at 12:30 p.m. In terms of the format, the speaker is invited to deliver remarks on a topic of her choice (15-20 minutes), enjoy a nice lunch, and then conclude with a period of questions and answers (30-45 minutes), As indicated above, all discussion is confidential, the questions are informed and respectful, and we conclude promptly at 2:00 p.m. The Seminar meets in the back room of Perry's to facilitate freer discussion.

At this stage, I have the following dates available: July 19th, August 30th, October 4th, 11th, and 18th, or November 1st. If any of these dates is convenient for you, the members would welcome the opportunity to host you as a guest speaker.

Best regards and I hope that you will look favorably upon this invitation,

Mike Fitzgerald
