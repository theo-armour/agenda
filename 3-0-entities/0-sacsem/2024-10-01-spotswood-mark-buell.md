We’ll be with the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley to review their final analysis. Yes, that means we’ll be with seminarian Mark DiCamillo two weeks in a row. What an ideal time for California’s top political pollster to brief the Seminar. That’ll enable those so inclined to place insider bets on the outcome of election for president, Congress and mayor of San Francisco.

Friday, November 8 will be the “big roundtable” to analyze the results of November 5th presidential, congressional and city elections.
