POTENTIAL SAC SEM FACT FINDING TRIP: We are seeking to gauge the level of interest in a proposed Sacramento Seminar ‘Civil War Battlefield’ tour next year. These are our current thoughts: Timing: April 2025 for one week. Estimated cost: $3,000 per person including accommodation, professional guide, transportation, breakfasts but excluding lunch and dinner. You will need to make your own arrangements to get to and from the start/finish point, likely Washington DC. We will likely set up appointments in our Nation’s Capital with local elected officials and representatives of the new administration.

Without committing yourself it would be appreciated if you could send an email to Dennis Wheatley dennis@triticum.com to indicate interest, if we get enough people showing interest, we’ll start to firm up the arrangements.

FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: Seminarian Michael Semler sends from the New York Times, “How California Became a New Center of Political Corruption”

“A heavy concentration of power at Los Angeles City Hall, the receding presence of local news media, a population that often tunes out local politics and a growing Democratic supermajority in state government have all helped insulate officeholders from damage, political analysts said.”
