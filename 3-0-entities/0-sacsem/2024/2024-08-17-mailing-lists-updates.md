# 2024-08-17 Website Updates

Hello Jon, Dick, Dennis & Brian

The initial request was easy: Enable Brian to update the SacSem website to include the link to Dick's latest email.

The request was initiated due to a new security update required by Constant Contact, Dick's mailing list provider.

It turns out that a fix is quite easy to carry out, but it entails me going out to Mill Valley and logging into Dick's computer to implement. Having lived in Mill Valley fpr ten years, Shelter Bay is a wonderful place. Dining at Piatti's could also be a treat.

Past experience, however, tells me such visits lead to more visits. In this era a more productive solution is to initiate remote support.â€”do it all online. It turns out that Constant Contact facilitates such efforts. All it takes is upgrading to a multi-user account. I have initiated this process and will cover the costs for the near future.

Before sending out invitations to join, I have a number of questions for Constant Contact Support regarding a number of issues including

* Not doing anything in anyway that slows down Dick's good output
* Maintaining the complete separation and privacy of Dick's various newsletters and contact lists

Constant Contact human support is only available weekdays, so I will not get answers this weekend.

Nonetheless, I hope the upgrade  to open a new account allowing for three members will be initiated early in the coming week. When it's up, I will send invites to join to Dick and Brian.

There will be a number of benefits:

* If any one member has issues carrying out the tasks, another user wil be able to take over
* Support and enhancements can be carried out remotely
* New features can be implemented such as images in emails, text messaging support, email messages from any one to all or a subgroup.

Fingers crossed: It all works out as anticipated, I will keep you up to date.

Cheers,

Theo
