## Two things


Hi Mike

SacSem Speakers
The two best reasons for attending SacSem lunchs are the quality of the Speakers and the high level of the conversations. You are an important part of both aspects!

How can i help you? My political connections are no-existent, but i can help you with most any technical aspect you might call for.

If nothing else, it would be a good idea to build a playbook of you you fish for and land speakers. I would be delighted help with that.

Heritage on the Marina: Julia Morgan Building
As we discussed last week, 2025 will be the centenary of the Julia Morgan Building at Heritage on the Marina. I am helping plan not just a celebration but also upgrading the documentation and preservation of the building and its history. For example we are embarking on the process of getting into the Nationsl Register of Historic Places. I'm sure your connection to the San Francisco Historical Society can be useful.

We can continue this conversation at the next SacSem meeting or may I invite you over here for a meal and a chat?

Theo
