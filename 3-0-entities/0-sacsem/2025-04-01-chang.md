Presentation by the Director General at Sacramento Seminar

Dear Deputy Director Chang

First Kindly convey my thanks to Director General Lai and to yourself for participating in the Sacramento Seminar on Friday. I am delighted to report that Director General Lai's memory is quite wonderful. I checked with all 42 slides in his presentation and he was spot on with covering every aspect on the slides.

Even better, Director General Lai gave engaged, informed and lively answers to all the questions.

Second, I hope the Director General Lai will accept my humble apology for being unable to present his excellent PowerPoint. Of course when I returned home and used the right cable, it worked perfectly. I will be sure to use the right cable next time. ;-)

Thirdly, I hope that my fellow Seminarians asked thoughtful questions and engaging questions. We all learned a lot from the Director General's presentation.

Finally, I would like to thank you for your support of the Sacramento Seminar. I hope you and your colleagues at the Taipei Economic & Cultural Office will be able to join us again in the future.

Yours sincerely

Theo
