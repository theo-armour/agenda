I think the superconductor is the most important because it can make both PCNA and AI progress even faster.

Concept / Mission

* Is this article about control what you believe and what you do by controlling what you read?
* You are what you read
* Reducing anxiety
* Or is it about control and change?



## Worrying about bad things

A friend of mine writes

> Clearview AI has billions of our photos. Its entire client list was just stolen

> https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/tech/clearview-ai-hack/index.html

> Note - this is not the photos - this is all the law enforcement/police clients and I assume records of using the app to search for suspects. Imagine being contacted by the hackers who tell you they have the records, and that the NYPD have had you under surveillance - pay us or we will tell all your clients , contacts etc that you are under suspicion . You know (or do you actually know?) that it’s not true. Would one pay the ransom? Best regards, Frank

The above is the latest in ongoing discussions we have regarding hacking, surveillance, fake news and bad things happening via the internet. My replies usually revolve around observations such the probability of any of use being hurt is infinitesimal or it's happening to billions of people so not to worry.

Given that we repeat this discussion them often and never find a good solution, I now want to write a more detailed and considered reply.

I do listen to my friend. Hacking, surveillance, fake news and bad things are happening via the internet incessantly. Crimes are committed. People are hurt. Recovery can take much time, effort and money. In no way do I intend to diminish any of the aspects of these events. My heart goes to to the victims. Fingers crossed the bad peeps leave me alone.

Also I keep up to date on these events. I follow industry guidelines to attempt to minimize occurrences. I help others do the same.

On the other hand - and this may be a significant difference between my friend and me - I do not let myself become worried stressed or anxious about these threats.

* The more we value things outside our control, the less control we have. Marcus Aurelius
* There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can’t control. Ryan Holiday
* Focus on the things you can control, let go of everything else. Emma Pattee
* God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can And wisdom to know the difference. Reinhold Niebuhr

## Deciding What you can control or change

On any given day, there are billions of people suffering and innumerable populations of flora and fauna - all manner of living things being destroyed or threatened.

* Crime
* Disease
* Earthquakes, fires and storms
* Poverty and lack of amenities

If a bad thing happens on the other side of the world, there is little you can do about the situation. But what about situations in yur own community. For example, I live in San Francisco, California. A significant segment of the population live and sleep on the side walks. I know this because I have to walk around their bodies almost every time I leave my building. This situation is ongoing, local and involves large numbers of people. It's the sort of thing that I consider I should be able to control in some way.

In an article in the New York Times quoted a letter to the editors I had written:


> “What can we do to help the homeless and many others to find housing and gain better living conditions?” wrote Theo Armour, of San Francisco.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/us/homelessness-california.html
See also https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/us/how-to-help-homeless-california.html


The Times replied:

Experts say there is no way around it: In order to meaningfully address homelessness, more housing must be built. The links the article refers to point to over-regulation, nimby-isms, self-serving bureaucracies as factors hampering the efforts to build more housing.

In other words, there is little or nothing I as an individual can do to help resolve the plight of the people on the streets.

> Treat people you come across with dignity and respect. Don’t avoid eye contact, but do avoid making assumptions.

* If the problem can be solved why worry? If the problem cannot be solved worrying will do you no good.

## A day in the life

I am a single disabled 73 year old male living in downtown San Francisco. Several times a week I walk to my local supermarket to buy food

As I walk to the store, I could consider these possibilities

* Catch a disease from people near me
* Store cameras track me and the data ends up in the hands of bad people
* Be killed by an earthquake
* Be hit by a one of the numerous crazy people in the neighborhood
* Somebody hacks my bank account and takes out all the money
* People I don't like are elected. People I do like who are elected turn out to be ineffectual


Instead I choose to do things such as:

* Watch out for cars, bikes and scooters
* Pay attention to walking faster and farther to keep my daily walking statistics looking good
* Consider the food to buy that will best keep me healthy
* Chat with neighbors and store personnel I know
* Reflect on improving the workflow of the day
* Enjoy the moment and pass a thought or two about the peeps I love


## Conclusions: You can change the narrative

What can help you with deciding what you can take charge of?

May have something to do with: You are what you read

COACH: curiosity, openness, affiliations, conscientiousness, and healthy lifestyle.

Control what you read

* Media is all about big things you cannot control or change by yourself
* Read the other side's media

Will it give you a moment of joy?
	* See or be in beauty every day
	* Email with a work of art
	* Walking

* Change or control something frequently
	* I happen to write software
	* could be writing or keeping statistics

* improv?
* What, me worry? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman


### [Drucker quotes]( https://succeedfeed.com/peter-drucker-quotes/ )

* What gets measured gets improved
* There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.
* Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right
* if you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.



### Aside: The Difference Between Worry, Stress and Anxiety

* https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/smarter-living/the-difference-between-worry-stress-and-anxiety.html

### Worry

* Worry is what happens when your mind dwells on negative thoughts, uncertain outcomes or things that could go wrong
* When we worry, it calms our brains down
* Worry is also likely to cause us to problem-solve or take action, both of which are positive things
* Worry is a way for your brain to handle problems in order to keep you safe
* When you notice that you’re worried about something, push yourself to come up with a next step or to take action.

### Stress

* Stress is a physiological response connected to an external event
* In order for the cycle of stress to begin, there must be a stressor
* This is usually some kind of external circumstance, like a work deadline or a scary medical test.
* Stress is defined as a reaction to environmental changes or forces that exceed the individual’s resources
* In prehistoric times, stress was a natural response to a threat, like hearing a predator in the bushes.
* Get clear on what you can and can’t control. Then focus your energy on what you can control and accept what you can’t.

### anxiety

* If stress and worry are the symptoms, anxiety is the culmination.
* Anxiety has a cognitive element (worry) and a physiological response (stress), which means that we experience anxiety in both our mind and our body.
* When you’re in the middle of an anxiety episode, talking or thinking about it will not help you.
	* Try to distract yourself with your senses: Listen to music, jump rope for five minutes, or rub a piece of Velcro or velvet.
* Remember: Anxiety happens in your mind and your body so trying to think your way out of it won’t help.

### takeaway

* Worry happens in your mind, stress happens in your body, and anxiety happens in your mind and your body.
* In small doses, worry, stress and anxiety can be positive forces in our lives.
* But research shows that most of us are too worried, too stressed and too anxious.

Browser?

[Goodbye, Chrome: Google’s web browser has become spy software]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/?utm_term=.bcbed00a5ad2 )

I use https://brave.com/ and am happy so far.

Best regards,

## Brave browser ~ should be good

Good luck with Brave. It should be a fine browser.

The Brave organization was founded by one of my mostly heroes: Brendan Eich. Eich invented the programming language I use for all my work - JavaScript - in ten days. Eich was also a co-founder of Mozilla an Firefox but was asked to leave because he was seen to have donated to an anti-gay marriage movement

Interestingly, the [Brave browser]( https://github.com/brave/brave-browser ) - just like the upcoming versions of the Microsoft Edge browser - is built upon [Chromium]( https://www.chromium.org/ ) an open-source web browser initially and still developed by Google and others. As  they say, you can checkout but you can never leave.

## One of the few matters where I agree with our current president.

> “I do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news, where they go, ‘Fake news!’” the president said during an Oval Office interview with The New York Times. “I even see it in other countries. I don’t necessarily attribute that to me. I think I can attribute the term to me. I think I was the one that started using it, I would say.”

## So what is 'fake news"?

“News stories that have no factual basis but are presented as facts."

Allcott, Hunt; Gentzkow, Matthew (January 2017). "Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election." Stanford University, New York University, National Bureau of Economic Research: 5–6.
https://libguides.colorado.edu/c.php?g=645411&p=4541738


 “fake news” as those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources or quotes.
