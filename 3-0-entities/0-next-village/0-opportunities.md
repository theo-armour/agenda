What are some good websites for identifying specific ai utilities



In March of 1925, the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society held its first meeting of the Board of Directors om the premises of the Julia Morgan building

In 2025 the Board of Directors will hold its four hundredth quarterly meeting on the premises. To celebrate, the Board is sponsoring a gala event for local dignitaries (including the esteemed residents ;-).

Perhaps more important, we hope the commemoration enables new opportunities: Improved communication with the neighborhood, civic organizations and more.

NEXT Village SF, a neighborhood nonprofit providing services and support that help the elderly to live independently, is interested in organizing tours of the building, which in turn might lead to invitations to elders in the neighborhood attending lectures and performances on our premises.

Heritage SF is interested in a collaboration with me on writing an article on Julia Morgan's architectural intensions in the design of the building.

There may also be new opportunities for fundraising and sponsorship that tie in with the strategic plan for the campus.

These are all ideas. A hundred years ago the Society pivoted from being primarily an orphanage to being a retirement community. This too started as just an idea.

A centenary celebration calls us to honor the past. May it also inspire ideas that envision and shape an even brighter future.
