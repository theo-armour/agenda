Hi Diana

I left it a bit late. I have a ton to say. I will just bullet some of thoughts. We can double-click on any of these when we meet. And, please note, this is late night writing and not to be relied on for anything.

## Fees: a few thoughts
I like to start at a low end of the scale and then move up with bonuses and raises. I am thinking of offering you $35 per hour.

I am very conscious of travel times and costs and will consider compensation for these.

I hope we could work out a plan for, say, ten to fifteen hours a month.

Most everything I do is digital. I hope I can pay using Zelle or PayPal. Payment early in the month for the previous month.


## Storage Unit

You have seen all the stuff. The project at hand is to find nice new homes for everything. It's not about selling or disposing of anything. It's about finding the right place for everything. This is a project that will take a long time. I hope we can work on it together.

## Tech

Your tech experience intrigues me. Once everything is scanned (somehow) how does one manage and maintain these digital? Interesting question, I think.

Everything I do is free and open source. It's not about making money. It's about making both the content and the tools work for people no matter their economic status.

## Chat

You talked of being an anarchist. This is not a usual worldview. It is intentional, studied and pushy. As you have been able to observe, I come from an extremely privileged background. I am very conscious of this and have worked hard at being a father of three daughters who normal and to be unselfish in friendship and more. I am very interested in your worldview and how you came to it and finding points of agreement and disagreement.

## Next steps

We should zoom or meetup.

Hi Diana. Thank you very much for your wonderful efforts last week. I really appreciate your professionalism and your sharps eye. I hope and look forward to another session with you. The objective: finish with finding photos and then starting to collect these into something that can be shipped tp the scanning people.

I also talked to Donna about my employing you for techie work. I specifically said that I initiated the request and that anything we might do would absolutely follow Next Village guidelines.

Donna said this could be possible. It would be organized by Jacqueline who is not back for another week. It would also involves us signing a document that this effort is not part of Next Village.

very effective hour in storage

very much into anarchy

Must talk to her about "The Gaze"

Tuesday 10:30

2024-11-09 txt: Diana: I really look forward to meeting you and getting things done. But, please can we reschedule? Either 11:30 or another day?

Allowing for 30 minutes to go, 60 minutes there, and either 30 minutes back (or you leave from the storage). I will be able to reserve the Heritage van, so getting there and back should be easy. Cheers, Theo
