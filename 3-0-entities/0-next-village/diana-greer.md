Tuesday 10:30

2024-11-09 txt: Diana: I really look forward to meeting you and getting things done. But, please can we reschedule? Either 11:30 or another day?

Allowing for 30 minutes to go, 60 minutes there, and either 30 minutes back (or you leave from the storage). I will be able to reserve the Heritage van, so getting there and back should be easy. Cheers, Theo
