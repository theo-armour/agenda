Hi Diana. Thank you very much for your wonderful efforts last week. I really appreciate your professionalism and your sharps eye. I hope and look forward to another session with you. The objective: finish with finding photos and then starting to collect these into something that can be shipped tp the scanning people.

I also talked to Donna about my employing you for techie work. I specifically said that I initiated the request and that anything we might do would absolutely follow Next Village guidelines.

Donna said this could be possible. It would be organized by Jacqueline who is not back for another week. It would also involves us signing a document that this effort is not part of Next Village.

2024-11-09 txt: Diana: I really look forward to meeting you and getting things done. But, please can we reschedule? Either 11:30 or another day?

Allowing for 30 minutes to go, 60 minutes there, and either 30 minutes back (or you leave from the storage). I will be able to reserve the Heritage van, so getting there and back should be easy. Cheers, Theo
