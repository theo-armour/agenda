Hi Donna

Sorry for my slow Reply to all your messages. Getting the newsletter out seems to take up all my brain cells. And then it takes a week or so to recover. ;-)

Name: Heritage on the Marina
It turns out that There are a number of organizations in the Bay Area that have Heritage in their name. One of them is an Old People's home in Walnut Creek. Therefore, we always use "Heritage on the Marina" - At least at the first use in a text. And then heritage without the "The" afterwards. I'm letting you know this so that when you contact our people. You can use the correct name.

Contact person at Heritage on the Marina
The person is Roxana Lara ~ rlara@heritagesf.org ~ 415 792 5462. Please wait for me to make the introduction. I want to talk to Mary Linde ~ mlinde@heritagesf.org ~ (415) 202-0343 ~ our CEO first. I had planned to talk To her before Thanksgiving, but the meeting got postponed. I will try to set one up in the next few days. Things will be more productive with her blessing.

January Heritage on the Marina tour
How about 1/13 or 1/15 or 1/16? The light in the afternoon is good for viewing the front of the building. So 3pm? Setting a maximum of say a dozen people. I. thinking about half an hour for the tour of the building and then about fifteen minutes on San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society founded in 1853. Perhaps with tea or coffee.

Paradise Village Senior Community newsletter
Awesome! And I look forward to, fingers crossed, meeting another old peeps newsletter editor one day. Drop off next week is good.

Lighted Boat Parade
I just registered myself. I did not provide details in the Heritage Happenings. The event overlaps with thr monthly birthday cocktail party and dinner. It's best not to have conflicting events.

I plan to sent out an email message to residents on Thursday. There are a few strong walkers here. I hope One or two might stop by. I plan to come down after dinner.

Of course there's more. But enough for now.

Cheers,

Theo

Theo -

It was wonderful to meet you yesterday and thank you for lunch and the tour.

Any time I walk by The Heritage I'll be looking for the Tudor roses!

I found information on the Awesome Foundation. I'll forward it to our Executive Director Jacqueline as funding type programming is in her domain (I'm focused on neighborhood based community programs for SF District 2 residents). She is out on medical leave for next 2 weeks, so responses will be delayed, but if you don't hear back from her when she returns, let me know & I can make sure she saw the info. And please send additional thoughts re: your vision for a local Awesome group.

Would love to partner with Heritage if there are some programs that you think would be useful or fun for both groups.

The one I mentioned is the Aging Mastery Program by the National Council on Aging. Click here for info on the program & curriculum. If you think might be of interest, let me know whom to contact at the Heritage re: logistical stuff.

Re: an online forum for information. I love the idea, but my enthusiasm is tempered by our experience that not all of our group (or Village newsletter editors) are comfortable with digital devices or online forums. In spite of our trying to provide step -by-step information and volunteers to work one-on-one with NEXT members to try new technology, it can be hard to get traction. I was just telling a group about the NEXT Village podcast "Not Born Yesterday" and a discussion ensued on what's a podcast. Hopefully I've enticed some people to go to  https://notbornyesterdaypodcast.org/how-to-listen and listen to their first podcast.

We're always amenable to trying new things, but I just like to set expectations that it can be tricky to get Village people to use online forums for information and in addition to building it ... there needs to be a plan to get the word out to the target audience to get them to engage.

Camille has started a WhatsApp group so that NEXT Village member can connect with other members outside the phone tree directly to do things. Group chats include Dance, Foodies, Exercise and Fitness, Health and Wellbeing, Movies, Museums and Arts, Music, Outdoor Events and you are welcome to suggest others.

If you aren't already in our WhatsApp group, contact Camille our volunteer services coordinator at camille@nextvillagesf.org for instructions to join the group.

Last but not least, we'd love to have you do a tour of The Heritage to celebrate its 100 years.

Want to aim for January of February? Or let me know what works for you. Our December calendar is already pretty busy plus we are anticipating people may be busy over the holidays, so was thinking early in 2025, but LMK your thoughts.

Would be great if we could combine history tour with some information for people who might be considering Heritage as a future home.

Thanks again for showing me around The Heritage and the great conversation!

Let me know if there's anything else I was supposed to follow up on that I forgot.

Donna

### me

Hi Donna (and Camille)

>>It was wonderful to meet you

Exactly the same from me to you. We covered so many topics of interest and familiarity to both of us. And you remembered them all!

Please note my typing is pretty slow and I don't use voice recognition enough yet so my emails may not be as detailed as your excellent efforts!

Awesome Foundation

I will be attending the monthly meeting tomorrow. Here are the projects we are looking at:https://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/chapters/6/projects?end=2024-10-31&page=2&q=&start=2024-10-01

I received a postcard from Jacqueline today. Before she comes back I will write up something summarizing my thoughts or ideas.

Aging Mastery Program

Yes. Yes. Yes. I will establish the connection. And in doing so facilitate attendance by NV members.
Dining with EldersBy the way I had tons of fun with visits by La'mère Carter and Saoirse. Can we work out something where volunteers get invited for a meal in our dining room and I plant them at a table with three old people? Or something like that?

NotBornYesterday

I will add a link to our monthly newsletter

Tech & Old People

I hear you. It's still early days. The people I would like to connect with are others in NV who are already quite tech-savvy.

Richard Caro

Also we never finished the dialog about Richard Caro and Tech Enhanced Life. Did anything ever happen there?

WhatsApp

I think there may be enough in the message that might be of interest to camille. I am copying her on this message.  

Hi Camille: may I join the whatsapp group?

Tours of Heritage on the Marina

I will be delighted to give tours of my 1925 Julia Morgan mansion. And I would also like to discuss having meetings and get-togethers here - in the parlor or the cottage. And early 2025 sounds good.

Please note that there are lots of places with "Heritage" in their name. To differentiate ours is "Heritage on the Marina".

Diana Greer

Magic introduction: Get Things Done!

Links of Interest

Here is a paper with lots of photos of the roses starting on page fourhttps://heritage-happenings.github.io/pages/2024/eir/the-roses-of-3400-laguna.pdf

Here is a link to the monthly newsletter I produce:

Of course, there's more. But enough for now.

Cheers,

Theo
