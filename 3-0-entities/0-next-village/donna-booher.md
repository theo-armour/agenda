Theo -

It was wonderful to meet you yesterday and thank you for lunch and the tour.

Any time I walk by The Heritage I'll be looking for the Tudor roses!

I found information on the Awesome Foundation. I'll forward it to our Executive Director Jacqueline as funding type programming is in her domain (I'm focused on neighborhood based community programs for SF District 2 residents). She is out on medical leave for next 2 weeks, so responses will be delayed, but if you don't hear back from her when she returns, let me know & I can make sure she saw the info. And please send additional thoughts re: your vision for a local Awesome group.

Would love to partner with Heritage if there are some programs that you think would be useful or fun for both groups.

The one I mentioned is the Aging Mastery Program by the National Council on Aging. Click here for info on the program & curriculum. If you think might be of interest, let me know whom to contact at the Heritage re: logistical stuff.

Re: an online forum for information. I love the idea, but my enthusiasm is tempered by our experience that not all of our group (or Village newsletter editors) are comfortable with digital devices or online forums. In spite of our trying to provide step -by-step information and volunteers to work one-on-one with NEXT members to try new technology, it can be hard to get traction. I was just telling a group about the NEXT Village podcast "Not Born Yesterday" and a discussion ensued on what's a podcast. Hopefully I've enticed some people to go to  https://notbornyesterdaypodcast.org/how-to-listen and listen to their first podcast.

We're always amenable to trying new things, but I just like to set expectations that it can be tricky to get Village people to use online forums for information and in addition to building it ... there needs to be a plan to get the word out to the target audience to get them to engage.

Camille has started a WhatsApp group so that NEXT Village member can connect with other members outside the phone tree directly to do things. Group chats include Dance, Foodies, Exercise and Fitness, Health and Wellbeing, Movies, Museums and Arts, Music, Outdoor Events and you are welcome to suggest others.

If you aren't already in our WhatsApp group, contact Camille our volunteer services coordinator at camille@nextvillagesf.org for instructions to join the group.

Last but not least, we'd love to have you do a tour of The Heritage to celebrate its 100 years.

Want to aim for January of February? Or let me know what works for you. Our December calendar is already pretty busy plus we are anticipating people may be busy over the holidays, so was thinking early in 2025, but LMK your thoughts.

Would be great if we could combine history tour with some information for people who might be considering Heritage as a future home.

Thanks again for showing me around The Heritage and the great conversation!

Let me know if there's anything else I was supposed to follow up on that I forgot.

Donna
