the production of electricity via photovoltaic cell becomes a continuously declining expensive. 

Eventually the price of electricity becomes negligible.

When thi happens the cost of running factories that make robots that make factories, in turn, eventually becomes negligible.

Eventually the average family has access to more electricity than they can use and robots to help with any task.

One of the tasks of the robots will to manipulate 3D printing and recycling devices that manipulate printable building material.

The average family will then live in the architecture of its ongoing choosing.

Thir abode will update form and function on daily basis.

The robots will carry out a myriad of tasks from changing the overall style for the week from mock Tudor to rural Japanese all the way to gingerly removing a spider from the underside of a gutter and transporting her to a safe part of the garden.

Form and function cease to be frozen music - merely frivolous thoughts.
