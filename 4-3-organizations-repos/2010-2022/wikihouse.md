Hello WikiHouse peeps

My name is Theo Armour.

I live in San Francisco - and have lived in NY, London, HK & Paris. I have an AADip.
I was the first AutoCAD dealer in Asia. I worked with Autodesk for a number of years and was program manager for three releases of AutoCAD. More recently I have been involved in a string of failures helping start-ups. ;-)

In 2015, I did quite a bit of work related to WikiHouse. You can see the demos at:

 https://wikihouse.github.io.

Ditto demos for OpenDesk at:

http://opendesk.github.io/design-playground/

More recently, I built animated 3D demos for assembling Ikea furniture at:

http://jaanga.github.io/moving-manuals/

All the demos are free, open source and built in 100% plain vanilla JavaScript. The intent is to write demos at a level that may be edited and enhanced by designers and engineers who are just OK at coding.

Here's the next gig:

There's a new virtual reality (VR) tool: https://aframe.io/

> A-Frame is a web framework for building virtual reality experiences. It was started by Mozilla VR to make WebVR content creation easier, faster, and more accessible.

> A-Frame lets you build scenes with just HTML while having unlimited access to JavaScript, Three.js, and all existing Web APIs. A-Frame uses an entity-component-system pattern that promotes composition and extensibility. It is free and open source with a welcoming community and a thriving ecosystem of tools and components.

Wouldn't it be a good thing to have assembly instructions for these projects in VR aas well as in 3D??

https://github.com/wikihouseproject/StepUp
https://github.com/wikihouseproject/Microhouse

Of course each of these would be fully parameterized and export to DXF, SVG or whatever. All work will be kept and run from GitHub.

Help is needed for testing, user experience, satisfying CNC requirements and even with the coding.

Are you interested in a WikiHouse VR project? Could you offer advice or help?

Theo
