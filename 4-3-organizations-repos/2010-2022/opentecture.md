# Opentecture

Hi Ryan

You and I both have thousands of bookmarks we treasure. And we are not alone in hoarding bookmarks.

These bookmarks might be considered a pile of junk or the may be considered as a highly useful assemblies of knowledge.

There are a number of issues holding back our collections of bookmarks from being useful:

* Exporting a limited subset of bookmarks is not possible - it's all or nothing
* Sharing, collaborating on and curating collections of tags among groups of people is not easy
* Adding and maintaining tags is not possible on all browsers
* Adding and maintaining user comments and descriptions is not possible on most browsers
* Current methods for managing bookmarks are highly linear and paper-oriented
* And many more issues with bookmarks await to be described

This message is the first step in a request for ideas for online open-source tools for useful, collaborative bookmarking.

I would appreciate your thoughts on how to proceed with developing a spec, defining an MVP or doing whatever it takes for giving this story a happy ending.




## Request for proposals

There are people who have thousands of bookmarks in their browser bookmarks folders. These might be considered a pile of punks or the may be considered as a highly useful assembly of knowledge

There are a number of issues holding back collections of bookmarks from being useful:

* Exporting a limited subset of bookmarks is not possible - it's al or nothing
* Sharing and collaborating on collections of tags among group of people is not easy
* Adding and maintaining tags is not possible on all browsers
* Adding and maintaining user comments and descriptions is not possible on most systems
* This list of things you have issues with in bookmarks will be added to

This issue is the first step in a request for ideas for an online open source collaborative bookmarking system

We are looking for

* User interface
* Curation of collections of bookmarks

It is hoped that the collections of bookmarks will lend themselves to the creation of mind maps in 3D
