zip file > extract all

exe and folder - no read me
Leap SDK folder no read me

Docs folder - no read me - but at least an index.html

index.html opens to 'C++ SDK Documentation'

No where on the age is there any text indicating docs for any other language

The only indication is a tiny downward point triangle

Eventually we find it

LeapSDK/docs/javascript/devguide/Project_Setup.html
You can access the libraries remotely from Leap Motionâ€™s servers:

The contributors license seems OK
