# Pure JavaScript

## 2022-12-29

Salut Jérôme

I am a fan of your article "Design: #noFramework". It is clear, comprehensive, opinionated and a good read.

I am also a fan of simple JavaScript and I feel that there are few currently available resources to support usage.

Do you have any follow-up efforts or do you know about collaborative efforts?

Certainly, Christopher Ferdinandi has generated a lot of material but he is more of a sole practitioner than a collaborator.

If you are interested, I would be pleased to start a dialog with you on the topic of following up on your good article by providing access to resources and collaborators. All open sources, hosted with Pages in a GitHub organization repo etc. I would be pleased to be a contributor and maintainer in such an efort.

BTW, Je parle et lis le français mais surtout au niveau d'un enfant.

Bonne année

Théo
