## Zoom Wedding

## Drive by wedding

A certain dates we will visit your city and drive by your house. We will stop by your place for a chat and your blessing on our vows.

## Wedding comes to you

A package will be delivered to you with contents for use during the wedding.

During the zoom service, we will all eat or light or wave such and such items at the same time. The collective action will be visible to all.

## Drive In wedding

At pre-arranged times we will visit designated locations - Crissy Field, Lake Merritt and walk along a designated track at a designated time. We hope you will walk in the other direction and chat with us as we pass by
