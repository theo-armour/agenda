Dear Vivian,

I, Isabelle Ferté Armour, am writing this letter to declare that I have no interest in the estate of my former spouse, Norman Armour (AKA Theo Armour), with whom I was married in France in 1981 and legally separated in Marin County, California, in 2001. We have three daughters.

I hereby waive any right I may have to inherit from Norman Armour's estate upon their death. This includes, but is not limited to, any real estate, personal property, financial accounts, or other assets located in the United States or France.

I understand that this letter serves as a legal document and that by signing it, I am giving up any rights I may have to any assets, property, or possessions owned by my former spouse upon their death.

I have received legal advice from my attorney, David Sutton, Esq, regarding my rights to inherit from Norman Armour's estate and the legal implications of signing this waiver. I fully understand the implications of this waiver.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or clarification.

Sincerely,

Isabelle Ferté Armour
