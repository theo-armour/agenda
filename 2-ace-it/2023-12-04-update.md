UTI
Last week I was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI). I am taking antibiotics and feeling better. I am still tired and sleeping a lot, but much better than last week.

As with all similar issues, there is am ongoing toll on my ability to stand upright and walking with a cane without damaging my right shoulder.


Claudia

I am most likely employing Claudia Kraehe to manage the disbursement of possessions. I will be meeting her at my Storage units Tuesday morning.

> Several years ago, I researched downsizing, documenting, and organizing services and found your name. A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned to my friend Santani Teng that I was looking for help. He suggested you. I checked my list of names and found your name at the top of my list. So here we are. ;-)
