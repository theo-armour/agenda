## Me

I live in a retirement home in the marina.
A Tudor style mansion designed by JM
I am one of the youngest residents
But being disabled, I feel safer living here than else where
And it gives peace of mind to my daughters
I am secretary of the residents association
I am the editor of the monthly newsletter
I am on the BoD of WSD
I am consultant and software developer for Ladybug.Tools
I mentor several younger people with their startups
My own startup - EverEverLand - is a work in progress

I am in reasonably good health, I am being useful, I am happy
