### Opener

I'm no expert. I'm a beginner.

Here are some of my my theories

I'm making up as I go along

Here are some of my ideas

## Get a platform / Generate content

### Public speaking

* Because I'm up here and speaking to you - in a few minutes - you all know me
* When we chat afterwards, ity wil be like chatting to somebody you know
* Maybe you are not a speaker, but perhaps you write a blog, or you are a podcaster, or you are a YouTuber. Generating content is a way to connect with people.
* A checkbook is a good as content
* A chateau in the country is as good as content
* Knowing a good place to find mushrooms

## Your address book is your net worth

* The people you know are the people who can help you
* Your subscriber list
* get that phone number
* Business cards are still a thing


## Social networks help but

* Your meetups

## Connecting: Invite, invite, invite

* It's for fun
* A lunch together, a game of volleyball, a walk in the park
* Create outside shared experiences

## I'm not selling you anything - except for superconnection of course

* We are not selling to each other
* We are a fan club
* We are a support group
* We are a network of people who can help each other

Energy prompt

My Energy has a color which is dark purple, with shapes of very sharp triangles. The movement of the energy is very fast, the music style that would resemble it is heavy metal.

Observations

You know I always look at the copyright date. If the date is not updated, the site has not been updated.

CircaNomics copyright: 2020

Also: Link to Instagram is broken.

Therefore: Look hard for the something solid and real and actually happening now.

Compliance ~ being

* Adhere to Deep Compliance, Auditing, Accountability, Responsibility and Transparency
* Obtain and maintain recognition from bodies that matter:
* SDG, federal, regional, local, economic sector, industry whatever
* Connect with GDR, GSI, get staff involved in their committees
* Fingers crossed: In return:
* you receive numbers that count, numbers that are useful
* Feedback, accolades that are useful
* Team members: receive extra career fulfillment - would not receive internally

Numbers ~ Knowing

[https://twitter.com/G\_S\_Bhogal/status/1636876184863797248](https://twitter.com/G_S_Bhogal/status/1636876184863797248)

15.  Scoreboard Principle: Metrics motivate. Quantifying your progress on a task will push you to work harder, as it’ll become like a game in which you’re trying to increase your score. Find ways to number your progress, and you’ll become determined to make the numbers grow.

* Really Useful. Much wanted. Allows accessing to others peoples stats. Enables comparisons
* Goals ~ targets ~ metric: it's all about the numbers
* Ultra Measurable. It must be measurable
* The numbers must be meaningful to the individual - personal data on a timely identifiable basis

Design ~ Doing

* There's an app for that.
* Make it so no human data entry.
* All data points are captured digitally, automatically, always
