## 2022-06-20 ~ lolo draft of possible message

Eloise recent experience of being dismissed from her hotshot crew may provide insight and direction.

Eloise almost ran a good enough time to qualify. This indicates she may be a very good runner, but not necessarily a great runner.

On the other hand the actions she took subsequent to the dismissal indicate that she was able to distance herself from the experience, analyze the process and then report observations to her superiors. She did so in a way that indicates that they apprehended the events not just from a human point of view but also from a deficiency in the institutional process point of view.

Given this insight: Eloise may better be suited to commanding rather than chopping.
