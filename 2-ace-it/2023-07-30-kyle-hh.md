# 2023-07-30 Kyle Heritage Happenings

Hi Kyle

I've attached a draft of the August Heritage Happenings.

Unfortunately, there is nobody to talk to here with an active graphic design or publishing mentality. Our delightful Pulitzer Prize winner prefers to live in his memories of interviewing presidents and their ilk. Thus, I receive little or no feedback on the intentions of crafting a publication suitable for the visually, cognitively, or physically impaired. Imagine looking at one of your readers reading the current issue holding a six-inch magnifying glass with hands that tremor. And thinking, "I might be like that one day."

I try to help. 14pt Verdana with a bit extra line spacing (1.08 x line height). Everything left-justified. Every page is almost always a single topic. No underlines. No All caps. The color for headlines, etc is "red brick" (which is also the Wi-Fi password and the color of the bricks in the building).

I'm wondering if you might be able to come up a suggestion or two for improving the feeling and warmth of the pages as a whole? What are possibilities for a bit more spale and sizzle? What could give more pleasure to the old eyes and minds? A thought or two on the layout? I'm open to any and all suggestions. No deadline.

Theo
