## what does Theo really want

* Perhaps it's lack of boredom or just disinterest

Mission

* Technical competence ~ shared visions of the nice aspects of tech used wisely
* A love of art - in touch with something beyond us
* A sense of history - past and future
* A sense of agency - we do something useful and purposeful
* We have huge assets - we use these wisely, nicely and generously
* We are people of a family ~ we actively engage with others and our own
* We are smart ~ we can figure things out that helps others
* We perform ~ maybe it's dancing, or a soccer match or just a swim in the sea - we live in active moments
* We use each others skills to make the thing that is greater than its parts
* Party time! ~

We are something more than consumers of media who measure the passage of time by Hallmark Instagram moments
