okay for okay wow oh that's right okay you're right right like last year but oh good oh Sicily oh that should be lovely do you know that was one of my good friends in the Google and I had a house there oh what's the name of yeah I also wanted that yeah but a little island whatever I can look her up but you know I'd stick you yeah right if I get you yeah I'm right right I'll try and see you yeah yeah good all right and I heard I heard from Tonya that you had a nice chat with Tanya good so how's life right yeah good oh oh okay yeah sure yeah right right right but I do have I have kind of aI have money in the bank I'm overwhelmed yep and I've got to simplify you know love to work for them full-time but I can't I've got to simplify God to get rid of the furniture I've got to get the paintings to you in the furniture and I'm just doing it is so much I want to do right it's not no it's me yeah yeah exactly exactly so I'm trying to temper my own enthusiasm and I don't worry I will be part of it but you know there's so much joy and and I love the energy and and the dialogue I so wish to be part of it and end up but so I got to work it out yeah yeah I know I got don't worry don't worry new information and I'm really cut down and it made me depressed or nonproductive but then you know right right it's probably normal and and yeah I didn't have no drinks but I mean I was much more sensible except at the end I was so frustrated on Saturday that when I went out and had went to Calder into the wine bar and went to my horseshoe and had a drinks over 6 hours don't please don't criticize on that okay yes people on the case and things like that but look if I can share things with you if I feel like I can don't jump on it okay and the other day you know I was talking about having only one or two drinks or something like that and you criticize me for drinking cheap wine and stuff like that that doesn't help when when people are down you know and having issues pull them through it don't don't don't hit them sticks before so I'm reviewing it so revealing it and talking about it and I've been talking to Gary about it and you know I looked into Alcoholics Anonymous and all these yucky organizations and whatever and maybe cuz something good could come out of me and I read certainly a lot about it and I'm picking up drinking non-alcoholic beers and mocktails and things like that so oh yeah I got them some I've got some non-alcoholic rum behind me right now that I'm mixing with mixtures and things like that so it's it's moving in a good direction but they always jumps and splint and I can laugh about it yeah that's what it's about it and being amusing and and laughing myself and laughing at the world and getting home with it but I was very you know very depressed very non-productive and very unhappy for 5 days so I didn't because some of it was I mean the movie what a glass of wine and I start producing emails and I feel happy again except produce something that I wanted to produce now it's not as if I'm not being productive I'm just doing non-essential productivity things instead of essential productivity you know I've been secondary goals rather than primary goals or I'm just you know of course I mean I write like much more freely just the way people have 400s of years thousands of years certain you know you have fewer inhibitions and and words come out well they want 5 days without running so that was the issue yeah yeah this is so much going on there I'm having a nice time working with Mia Harlock on doing the happening so she's going to be helping and then me to do with one hand and the space is great I don't have sort of like aa cart I can put things on so I need to move books where they can be sorted out and and decided to take place so I may use this guy Carlos to help me and Mia is going to help me with some of the paperwork and of course continue with Claudia and things like that so that's what I really really have to get back into and spend you use my Consciousness on that say rather than Sensei a few hours a week or whatever but the main thing is stop spending $2,000 a month in the storage and but it's been very depressed because I'm trying to get somebody to take the furniture so no matter what the furniture I've got a good go back to Florida and I got some emails and I got to shipping quote and I don't care what it is we're going to use use the money in the bank that I got in the bank you sent to you they were over undergoing for anything under 5,000 simple as that and it won't you know that'll get just the chairs and stuff in in Lawrence but there's still more furniture to go and but anyway that's where hopefully Carlos will help and I can start getting the books out and so I've just got up to spend the time organizing that process and calls to be a good one and I met another guy over the weekend that could help with the scan documents Maybe once once you're scanned organizing those cuz that's another whole other process is getting the Bits of Paper scam but what do you do with them and how do we get them into the internet archive and things like that every single call that was made so you know all the long distance calls who they were in touch with and you can watch the chain over months to England okay to Taiwan thinks of that so there's a history in there and then you go link that to the passport entries and you link that just you know the maybe some of the faxes that are rent oh that's when oh and then the business card oh that's when you know tell me that you have a future AI will look at it even today and that's okay there's that business card that's when Taylor met the person who's now the president taught hyena says you know what we just saw this companies yes and that's why I'm in Sensei I'm trying to create the Legacy one way or another the final design I don't know their details to be sorted out but of course not but I'm unique I'm special to me I'm not just anybody you know I have I want things to happen and I mean right and I love you haven't you have no idea how much of an interesting life that I've had is a small person changing China I mean I came to Autodesk in 1991 everybody was still on the drawing board by the time I left everybody was drawing on the screen and they were using the program I wrote and what took me a couple of hundred people were brought a desk but I designed the program that took virtually everybody off the drawing board and onto the computers in 10 years I didn't know that at the time and and you know it was a recent party about John Walker and whatever and I was talking with other people and I was explaining to them what they did and they had no idea what they had done they changed over that Autodesk 14 change the way people designed all over the world all in 10 years they just took it as regular jobs they had no View in the '80s you know when I first went to Hong Kong people were everybody nobody had used a computer to do a drawing by the time I left to go to Autodesk not minions but thousands of people in China were using computers to do engineering drawings so I've had sewn the seeds in China but for using technology to build and design things there's nobody else from Autodesk doing that everybody was stealing the software but I was the only one going around China and Taiwan say hello it's a company it's made by humans so I didn't change Sean it but I was certainly part of an Awakening 2010 3GS comes out webgl comes out who gave the first seminars of Google on using 3GS what is now the most popular JavaScript program in 2024 3js and I was the first person and you go back on the on the webgl Forum and the first email is about 3js or mine and the first demos to to Google into the world of 3js or mine and now you just got hundreds of millions of users so you know that is worth and I'm not a general I'm not a president or CEO I'm just an individual contributor but we're just as important the CEOs in many ways and I've got the demos I've got the drawings I've got the software and I got the faxes and I got all the evidence of things that are not good and and it's really hard to think of you're just nice good stuff that happens in the world that people do are helpful and visibly helpful and can make a change I mean little person like me can help change the world and I'm not going to evidence sometimes so not as you know in China there was nobody else from water that's but there are other people doing Cad and things like that but they were probably not more than 100 people in China in the '80s do anything near what I was doing and a lot of them was salespeople but nobody had to talk to little engineers bike bit by 1990 I could go to contacts in Taiwan and have a thousand people show up another time yes and my hands falling asleep cuz I'm holding the phone up to my ear because I'd close the door oh I've been recording this whole conversation I'm using on my browser oh well only my side of it I will do my best nighty night get some sleep and talk to you maybe Thursday or something like that okay okay love you Alex bye-bye
