# tkd

Hi Kyle and David

I have asked the powers that be to create a new whatsApp group that includes you. Isabelle appears to fear it would replace our beloved ace-it group. In the meantime, I propose TKD standing for Technical Knowledge Development. Er, Theo ~ Kyle ~ David.

So here I am sitting at my good end seat at the Shoe. Now at my second joint

I don't have any sons to chat with. Can you guys fill in? ;-)
