# 2024-11-28 Hong Kong Hat

Katie Loo just came back from Hong Kong. She brought me a baseball cap which, as she pointed out, has: the words "Hong Kong" in English and in Characters as well as a Dragon (she knows Cynthia is a Dragon). She also came with a page from the South China Morning Post celebrating the 45 years of MTRC which mentions the Island Line I helped design. The front page includes the names of the 12 stations I worked on.



Hi Mia

I have scheduled an Uber for 12:30 so I can have a short walk in Sausalito before lunch.

I will bring my walkabout computer which has an LTE connection so I can order an Uber to go home.

Every cloud has a silver lining: I have used the loss of the phone to excuse myself from two thanksgiving gatherings tomorrow I did not really want to attend. But I will be definitely double-denim-ing Poggio today.

>> David: Theo's going analog!

Try going to sleep know that there is no clock to look at in the morning. Try taking a photo holding a laptop with one hand and the button is nowhere near your finger. How will I know how many steps I have walked> You mean I will l have to walk just for the fun of it??!!

Through it. Seems like a nice happy book. An easy read a collection of thoughts gathered from Christianity and eastern religions and all over the place. Makes you think a little bit. There's a lot that just sort of pure mysticism and fairy tale like happy story things. Whether it's true or make believe, who cares? It's a nice happy read. Is it fact or fiction? does that make any difference?

I like the question-and-answer format. The writing is quite clear a matter of fact. Not overly woo woo. I can see why it has been so widely read. People like reading a book that makes them happy about being a happy people. And if the reader isn't happy it encourages them to be happy. Eckhart Tolle influenced by joseph Campbell? << Not ever stated

I just looked at the website. He does like to preach! And get paid for it! So that does kind of turn him into the traditional mystic, guru, a spiritual leader type of operation. He's being the front for a new religion of his own making.
