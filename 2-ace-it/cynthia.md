### Should Law Subsidize Driving

My take

* Given a well designed system, running in an optimal state, guided by intelligent, well meaning people there may still be endemic causes, instances and perpetuation of injustice.

* [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=3345366](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3345366)
* The cases of Allison Liao and Lauren Davis are not isolated injustices. It has been shown empirically that vulnerable road users (VRUs) are regularly blamed for their own deaths.183 After conducting a content analysis of 200 local news reports of crashes resulting in the deaths of people walking and biking, researchers concluded that “coverage tends to shift blame toward VRUs and away from drivers. Coverage almost always treats crashes as isolated incidents, obscuring the public health nature of the problem.”184 The scholars believe this “pattern of coverage likely contributes to the limited public outcry about pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities.”
* For example, an experienced personal injury lawyer in the space has stated that the NYPD follows an undocumented but rigid “observed violation” rule with regard to the law that requires motorists to yield to pedestrians.209 Under this rule, the police refuse to issue tickets under that law unless they personally observe a motorist violating it.210 Their stated justification is that judges would not uphold the citation unless an officer personally witnessed the incident.211 This rationale is absurd on its face; as the lawyer noted, it posits that a court would require “a higher quality of proof in order to establish a traffic violation” than to establish crimes like murder.
* . In most places, street parking is given away free of charge without regard to the residency or taxpaying status of the user. Further, street parking is reserved for cars. T
* The objective of central planners in establishing a minimum number of required spaces is to require private landowners to construct enough space “to satisfy the peak demand for free parking.”3
* The shift towards light trucks has likely taken the lives of thousands of additional people who were walking, biking, or using mobility devices to get around town. Research shows that a pedestrian is 3.4 times as likely to be killed if struck by an SUV or other light truck than if hit by a passenger car.
* by motorists (and virtually never the other way around),491 and are often blamed for their own deaths by police and media casually and without basis, these groups are structurally disadvantaged by a rule that makes them prove the person who killed them did so while failing to exercise due care.
* Say an SUV rolls over while the driver is making a turn, and severely injures a pedestrian and the driver. Assume that both victims believe this rollover to have been caused by a design failure of the manufacturer’s making, but cannot prove this. Claims for a defective product, such as an automobile, can be advanced on two similar but distinct grounds. First, the injured party may bring suit in tort, alleging the product was “not reasonably safe” or, similarly, was “unreasonably dangerous.” In principle, either victim could bring a tort suit on these facts. Second, a plaintiff harmed by a defective product may bring a breach of warranty claim in contract. Under this second option, a plaintiff may charge that an automobile manufacturer breached an implied or express warranty. The driver should be able to make this claim against the automobile manufacturer. A pedestrian who wants to sue a carmaker using the latter strategy, however, must confront his lack of privity. This requirement bars suits in contract where a plaintiff was not in a preexisting contractual relationship with the defendant.502 Thus, under a strict reading of this rule, an innocent bystander would be unable to sue an automobile manufacturer in contract. The lack of privity defense has been criticized for removing potential relief for innocent bystanders, who do not have any way of preventing or avoiding the risks caused by unsafe products.503 Even though it does not affect his tort claim, the lack of privity defense may prejudice the pedestrian’s rights in a few material ways.
* The lack of privity defense will systematically restrict the type of plaintiff who can bring a lawsuit against a car manufacturer for breach of warranty claims to exclude pedestrians. U.C.C. § 2-318 Alternative A,504 which has been adopted by a majority of states,505 bars innocent bystanders injured by defective products from bringing breach of warranty claims because of a lack of privity.506 The test for breach of contract (under an implied warranty of merchantability) requires only that plaintiff show the product was “not fit for the ordinary purposes such goods are used.”507 Thus, a plaintiff under a breach of warranty claim need not show the product was unreasonably dangerous. This difference can be dispositive.
* Thus, in this case, neither victim has an effective tort remedy, but while the driver has a contract remedy against the carmaker, the pedestrian does not. Contract doctrine is not the most natural fit for redressing harms to third parties who are not intended beneficiaries. Nevertheless, as with insurance regulation, the operation of tort law, traffic regulation, tax law, and myriad other fields, in contract it is once again unprotected non-drivers who pay the steepest price for law’s subsidy to driving.
* The most important subsidy for driving in the criminal law is in the area of enforcement. Enforcement of laws proscribing striking pedestrians are rarely enforced, even against hit-and-run motorists who kill their victims.509 In a recent study, even where motorists killed someone walking or using a wheelchair, they were charged with some form of homicide less than seven percent of the time. 510 In addition, car-related offenses are frequently defined as violations while ones relating to transit are crimes or otherwise result in graver consequences. Examples abound. In the ordinary course, the maximum penalty for a parking meter or HOV lane violation is a ticket, while boarding a subway or light rail without paying can trigger not only a fine but arrest.511 Ironically, delaying 50 bus passengers by temporarily parking in the bus lane is punishable by ticket, but boarding that same bus with an expired pass can trigger jail time.512 Motorists also enjoy more constitutional privacy protection in their car trunks than people riding the subway or walking down the street with respect to their person or belongings.513 Given the demographic makeup of the transit user base,514 the increased legal jeopardy and physical intrusion by law enforcement to which transit riders are subject cannot be understood without reference to race. Finally, even when motorists kill while driving negligently or recklessly, it can be difficult to secure a jury verdict of homicide. 515 For this reason, legislatures created a special category of homicide—vehicular manslaughter— for homicides committed with a car, 516 which is a lesser offense.

Law’s function is not only substantive but expressive, and of course in the real world these roles feed on each other. 518 Motorists today can make reckless choices that erase human life secure in the knowledge that they will not have to face the consequences.
