Much of the media I read discuss how Kamala lost the election. Gallaway's post paints the more compelling picture: how Trump won.

Kamala painted a picture of continuity and stability - what the "have" look for. Trump painted a picture of change and disruption - what the "have nots" look for.

Gallaway covers a number of topics, reading quickly, they all feel to have validity. I'm not sure how much of it is true, but it's a compelling narrative.

The media I read and the polls I follow were all wrong. We were living in fantasy land.

'The expression “The worse, the better” is often attributed to Vladimir Lenin, and captures a sort of messianic nihilism — the dream that escalating misery will hasten the fall of a corrupt order.'

If that is so then allowing Trump to install the worst of the worst to his cabinet may be the best thing for the US. It's a scary thought.

If Kamala had won, the "have" would have continued to be pleased. The "have nots" would have continued to have be angry and disaffected. With Trump winning, the haves are worried and the have nots are hopeful.

I am part of the group that feels impending doom. But I must not forget that over half my country is currently bubbling over with joy.

If Trump somehow succeeds in "making America great again" - whatever that means - then people will be happy. If he does not succeed then will that not be a huge wake up call for the have nots? From a Machiavellian point of view: win win.

Does this mean I have to watch Fox News in order to get the real news?
