Hi Alix

## Generally

Looking like it's beginning to settle down. I have a few comments below, but with a good final tidy, it's certainly good enough to start linking to it from LinkedIn etcetera


## Front page

### Opening paragraph

Not everybody may know what "circularity" means. A link to a definition would be this clear. Example:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy


### Activities & Clients

Nice selection of items!

Currently, each topic is now two lines.

* Minimise by NEEW Ventures
* Partnerships for Circularity

That is not quite enough to give a good idea of whether I should go there. You might add the headline on that page. For example:

* Finding the first customers in unchartered territories

## Knowledge Page

Including the "Knowledge" page is very good. It shows that you are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants


## Claudia's web site

Another example of a sole proprietor web site

* Mostly "we": https://www.stepbystepdownsizing.com/
* "she/her": https://www.stepbystepdownsizing.com/about/
