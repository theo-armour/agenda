Dear [Attorney's Name],

I, [Former Spouse's Full Name], am writing this letter to declare that I have no interest in the estate of my former spouse, [Your Full Name], with whom I was married in France in 1981 and legally separated in Marin County, California, in 2001. We have three daughters.

I hereby waive any right I may have to inherit from [Your Full Name]'s estate upon their death. This includes, but is not limited to, any real estate, personal property, financial accounts, or other assets located in the United States or France.

I understand that this letter serves as a legal document and that by signing it, I am giving up any rights I may have to any assets, property, or possessions owned by my former spouse upon their death.

I have received legal advice from my attorney, David Sutton, Esq., regarding my rights to inherit from [Your Full Name]'s estate and the legal implications of signing this waiver. I fully understand the implications of this waiver.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information or clarification.
