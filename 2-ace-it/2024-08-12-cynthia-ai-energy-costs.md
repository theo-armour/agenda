I certainly can agree that the implementation of AI has increased the use of energy.

Nonetheless the NPR article you linked to is not what I would consider to be an authoritative source. Two examples:

The opening line of the article :

"Researcher Jesse Dodge did some _**back-of-the-napkin math**_ on the amount of energy AI chatbots use."

Second paragraph:

"According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the energy consumption of data centeres..."

"Back of the napkin" and "Goldman Sachs" are not what I would consider to be authoritative sources.

There is much to be scared of with AI, but to me the scariest thing of all these days is news media.
