# **Wildfire-Driven Forest Conversion in Western North American Landscapes**

Wildfires are an integral part of many forest ecosystems in western North America. However, the characteristics of these fires have changed dramatically in recent decades. Wildfires have become more frequent, larger, and more severe due to a confluence of factors, including climate change, past fire suppression practices, and increased human ignitions 1. These shifts in wildfire regimes, coupled with significant departures from historical forest structure, species composition, and fire regimes, have increased the vulnerability of western North American forests to a phenomenon known as **wildfire-driven forest conversion** 2. This occurs when a forest that has been burned by wildfire fails to regenerate to its pre-fire state and instead transitions to a different vegetation type, such as shrubland or grassland 3. The increase in the area burned by western wildfires is associated with uncharacteristically large patches of high-severity, stand-replacing fire, further contributing to this conversion 2. This conversion can have cascading effects on biodiversity, carbon storage, and water resources.

## **Types of Forest Conversion**

Wildfire-driven forest conversion can manifest in various forms across western North America. One common type is the conversion of coniferous forests, such as ponderosa pine forests and pinyon-juniper woodlands, to shrublands, such as chaparral and sagebrush 4. This often occurs following high-severity fires that kill most or all of the trees in a given area. In the Southwest, high-severity fire is the primary driver of 75% of all vegetation type conversions 5. Increasingly common large and severe fires in the Southwest are now often followed by vegetation type conversions (VTC) where once-dominant vegetation fails to return to its pre-fire state 6. In these cases, conifer populations may fail to recover due to several factors, including:

* **Limited seed sources:** High-severity fires can destroy seed sources, making it difficult for trees to re-establish.  
* **Poor conditions for seedlings:** Warmer and drier postfire climate conditions can create unfavorable environments for conifer seedlings to survive and grow.  
* **Short-interval reburning:** If another fire occurs before the forest has had a chance to recover, it can further hinder tree regeneration and promote the dominance of shrubs 4. High-severity reburns can perpetuate and expand flammable shrub abundance at the expense of the forest 7.

Another type of conversion is the transition from shrublands to grasslands 8. This can occur in areas where wildfires are becoming more frequent, preventing shrubs from re-establishing and allowing grasses to take over. In some cases, repeated fires can even lead to desertification, where vegetation is replaced by bare ground 8.

## **Impacts of Forest Conversion**

Wildfire-driven forest conversion can have a wide range of ecological and societal impacts. Some of the key impacts include:

### **Biodiversity**

Forests serve as vital habitats for a rich tapestry of plant and animal life. When forests are converted to other vegetation types, this biodiversity can be significantly impacted. For example, the loss of coniferous forests can lead to declines in populations of birds, mammals, and other wildlife that depend on these habitats for food, shelter, and breeding grounds 9. Furthermore, altered fire regimes can render formerly well-adapted species vulnerable, leading to shifts in species composition and potential local extinctions 3.

### **Carbon Storage**

Forests play a critical role in regulating the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in their biomass and soils. When forests are converted to shrublands or grasslands, this carbon storage capacity is reduced. This can contribute to climate change by increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 10. Climate change models forecast an increase in wildfire activity, exacerbated by climate change and increased accumulations of hazardous forest fuels causing ever-larger wildfires....[source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://forestry.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Forest-Management-Carbon-and-Climate-Change-Final-1.pdf) 10.

### **Water Resources**

Forests influence water resources in several ways. They help to regulate streamflow, reduce erosion, and filter pollutants. When forests are converted to other vegetation types, these hydrological functions can be altered. For example, the loss of trees can lead to increased runoff and erosion, which can degrade water quality and affect downstream water users 11. Wildfires can affect streamflow by promoting water repellency and soil erosion 12. These changes can have significant implications for water supply, aquatic ecosystems, and human communities that rely on these water resources.

## **Role of Climate Change**

Climate change is a major factor contributing to the increase in wildfire frequency and severity in western North America 13. Rising temperatures, reduced snowpack, and prolonged droughts are creating warmer and drier conditions that make forests more susceptible to burning 14. These changes in climate are also altering fire behavior, leading to larger, hotter, and more severe fires 13. For much of the U.S. West, projections show that an average annual 1 degree C temperature increase would increase the median burned area per year as much as 600 percent in some types of forests 15. Drought and persistent heat set the stage for extraordinary wildfire seasons, as seen in recent years 1. Climate change has produced warmer and drier conditions with prolonged droughts that stress forest vegetation, facilitating pest outbreaks and tree death, leading to the accumulation of surface fuel 5.

## **Management Strategies**

Given the significant impacts of wildfire-driven forest conversion, it is essential to develop and implement management strategies to mitigate these effects. Increasing forest vulnerability to changing fire activity and climate compels shifts in management approaches 3. Some potential strategies include:

* **Fuel management:** Reducing the amount of flammable vegetation in forests can help to reduce the risk of high-severity fires. This can be achieved through thinning, prescribed burning, and other techniques 16. Targeted grazing can also be used to reduce invasive weeds, fine fuels (e.g., grasses), and ladder fuels (e.g., shrubs/brush) 17. The benefits of targeted grazing include reduced chemical and fuel use, increased carbon sequestration, wool and meat production, and reduced fire flame length and intensity.  
* **Restoration:** In areas where forests have already been converted, restoration efforts can be undertaken to re-establish trees and other native vegetation. This may involve planting seedlings, controlling invasive species, and promoting natural regeneration 16.  
* **Adaptation:** As climate change continues to alter wildfire regimes, it is important to adapt management practices to these changing conditions. This may involve shifting to more fire-resistant tree species, promoting landscape diversity, and incorporating climate projections into fire management planning 18.

## **Resilience to Wildfire**

Wildfire-driven forest conversion can be viewed as a loss of resilience in forest ecosystems 3. Resilience refers to the ability of a system to absorb disturbances and maintain its function and identity. In the context of wildfire, resilience can be categorized into three types 18:

| Resilience Type | Climate and Wildfire Trends | Planning Horizons | Resilience Characteristics | Management Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Specified resilience | Stable | Years | Capacity of a system to absorb disturbance; retention of characteristics or identity after disturbance | (E) Fuels management to help burned forest recover to similar state; (S) Rebuild similar structures in similar locations; help community recover economically |
| Adaptive resilience | ...[source](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1617464114) (S) Build and retrofit structures adapted to withstand future wildfire; adopt effective preventative community wildfire...[source](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1617464114) (S) Relocation of communities away from wildfire-prone areas; extensive public health programs to manage significant population exposure to smoke |  |  |  |

Understanding these different types of resilience is crucial for developing effective management strategies that promote the long-term health and sustainability of forest ecosystems in the face of changing wildfire regimes.

## **Synthesis and Conclusion**

Wildfire-driven forest conversion is a complex and multifaceted issue with significant implications for the environment and society. The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires, driven in part by climate change, are altering forest ecosystems in western North America. This conversion can lead to the loss of biodiversity, reduced carbon storage, and altered water resources. These changes have cascading effects on wildlife populations, carbon sequestration, water quality and availability, and overall ecosystem health.

To mitigate the impacts of wildfire-driven forest conversion, a multi-pronged approach is required. This includes implementing proactive fuel management strategies to reduce the risk of high-severity fires, undertaking restoration efforts to re-establish converted forests, and adapting management practices to the changing climate and wildfire regimes. Furthermore, incorporating the concept of resilience into forest management planning is crucial for promoting the long-term sustainability of these ecosystems. This involves recognizing the different types of resilience and developing strategies that enhance the adaptive capacity of forests to withstand and recover from disturbances.

Addressing wildfire-driven forest conversion requires collaboration among scientists, land managers, policymakers, and local communities. By working together, we can develop and implement effective strategies that promote the long-term health and resilience of western North American forests in a changing world.
