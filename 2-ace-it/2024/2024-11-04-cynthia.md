Dear Cynthia

My love is:

## Unconditional

My love is given with zero expectation, anticipation, or obligation of reciprocity.

My love is given constantly.

Mythical example: If I were to meet Mr Hitler or Mr Stalin, I hope I would be able to say: "Good morning". In other words no matter my loathing for the actions of a person, I hope I would treat that person in the same way that I would treat any other human I engaged with.

Expressions of love my others are accepted and appreciated, but not required.

## Variegated

My love for a stranger and my love for my daughters are different. One could say different levels of intensity or strength, but I prefer to say different types or qualities of love. Different categories each with its own qualities and characteristics.

My love is additive. As I become closer to a person, my love grows. My love does not diminish, though it may fade because of distance or time.

AI suggested: Different colors of love. << made me smile

AI suggested: My love for my daughters is more intense, but not more valuable. My love for my daughters is more specific, but not more important. << hallucination

## Specific

My love is specific (maybe). I cannot take somebody I have known for a year or so and move that person into the category of highschool classmate.

My love for my daughters is specific to them. I cannot take my love for my daughters and apply it to anyone else.

My love for each daughter is specific to that daughter. I cannot take my love for one daughter and apply it to another daughter.



No matter how clearly defined. No matter how much history. No matter how much trust. This does prevent messiness, vulnerability, misunderstanding, or hurt.

Cynthia, I love you.

I love you. Always. And in a way that is only for you.

Daddy
