Hi Quincy and Adam

Heritage on the Marina SingAlong
So the Singalong this month is on May 29 at 3pm

Featured songs will include songs fron the 40s amd 50s, including sings by

My guess is that a 3pm gig is not going to be a big draw, but I am happy to be wrong.

Alternative: SF Heritage Happy Hour

San Francisco Heritage has nothing to do with my Heritage on the Marina, But it's a totally cool organization and I am a member.  

Their monthly happy hour this month is at Izzy's on Steiner. I will be attending.
