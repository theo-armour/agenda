Tips on on Filming the Endiatx accomplishments

Hi Jason

In many of your videos, you focus on one or two founders. Your Endiatx video may benefit from a focus on the entire team.

Building the pill bot takes investigating nano-circuits, motors, robotics software, wireless transmission through liquids, data storage, optics, corrosive environments, 3D interactive user interaction, virtual reality, energy storage, miniaturization and more.

This takes much more expertise than one or two people can have.

I believe that if you focus on the team and the team's expertise, you will be able to acquire half a dozen insights and observations that will be useful to you in highlighting the complexity of the project and the expertise required to complete it. Team members are highly articulate and can explain their areas of expertise in a way that is accessible to the layman.

I look forward to seeing the video you and Endiatx produce.

Theo
