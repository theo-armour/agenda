## 2024-02-15 Endiatx ~ makes robot pills for telemedicine

Hi Jason.

I hope this message finds you as energetic as ever.

On Tuesday, I was giving away one of my AR devices (Brilliant's Monocle) on their Discord channel. My offer was responded to within minutes up by Quentin Caron of Endiatx. Within just over an hour he drove up from Hayward and we met at The Interval to carry out the transfer. This young Frenchman (your age) blew me away with his technical knowledge - EE & ME - and even more with his enthusiasm and energy. He's a real go-getter.

I know this because we really double-clicked into Endiatx where he is Chief Engineer.

"Endiatx makes robot pills for telemedicine. Our first product, PillBot, is a virtual endoscope or “moving eyeball in the stomach”. It's a pill camera you swallow that lets you access the world's best GI doctors without leaving home."

Later that evening he was back at the workspace in Hayward. He zoomed me into the latest test run of the PillBot. Torrey Smith, the CEO, led me through the testing process. To my delight, Torrey is just as energetic and engaged as Quentin.

There issues with the test run. So got to talk with a bunch of team members. I learned that the PillBot is entirely manufactured in the premises. 3D printing, flexible circuits, camera assemblies - all designed and built in-house.

Jason, I think you should meet these guys. They should be a great fit for your Saturday Startups. I'll be please to make the introduction.



## 2023-11-19 ~ discover the hover

Hi Jason,

Consider plenty of white space and information showing up on the fly

Hover is a good tool for this. And it's in all the browsers

Example with very dense realtime information

https://alltop.com

Try it yourself ~ scroll down and play with the several examples

https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/sel_hover.php

An alternative is to use "Link popins" that show up when you first click on a link

https://gwern.net/

Click on links in "newest" and "Popular"

BTW, gwern is a very smart person

PS Figma and Canva are good tools for building yesterday's websites


## this evening

Hi Jason

The world needs news that is helpful and hopeful ~ and is gripping and entertaining.

Even more the world needs news that helps solve problems.

Please help make this happen. ;-)

## AI: Where to focus?

I find it interesting that you plan to jump into AI by diving into deep learning, while I plan to get the broadest and trend-following view by including Large Language Models.

This may well be because we read different technical media.

My frequently media diet

* Feeds from Substack and Medium

I also end to left swipe my Samsung phone to get "random" news items from Google News

What tops your frequent media diet?
