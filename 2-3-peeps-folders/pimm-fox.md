Dear Pimm

Yep, "growing old is not for sissies".

Yep, everyone you say is true and I understand and have experienced all of your examples. And, I cannot imagine what it must be like being elderly in a war zone.

At the same time: My response: Have we boomers brought it up on ourselves? Have we obsoleted ourselves?

Below is a draft of a post I should write. Enjoy! ;-)

Cheers,

Theo

## Usefulness

A quote on Slashdot today that I agree with: "To stay youthful, stay useful."

I am 78. It's not easy being useful. I live in a small retirement community. Only 75 of us residents, and almost 75 workers looking after us.

My fellow residents are involved with a wide variety of activities. They play Mahjong. They read books. They travel. They play solitaire on their computers. They watch old movies. Is this being useful?

The people that work here are looking after us, they are doing useful things.

So, am I being useful when I am what it is that people are applying their uses to?

## How to stop old people from becoming boring?

I adore the old people I live with. In many ways, I consider where I live now the closest to paradise that I'll ever be. But that does not stop many of us, most of whom are in their 90s and 100s, from being quite boring. Of course, they're not boring the first time you hear them and talk. But they are boring after the 50th breakfast, having repeated the same 20 stories over and over again.

The old people of today seem to lived in the past. For some people, it appears that their lives were so tiring, they say that they are re-tired.

## The past is not the present

My great grandmother could teach you how to make thread using a spinning wheel or churn butter. My great-grandfather could teach you how to fix a plough or tell you the weather using a barometer.

Nowadays, my nephews could teach me how to play Fortnite and my nieces could tell me how to build a house using Minecraft. Or vice versa.

The grandchildren are more useful to the grandparents than grandparents are useful to grandchildren.

Of the 75 people I live with, approximately 25 have serious mental issues and 25 have physical issues and 25 don't have many issues, but have not done anything interesting for a while.

These days, the number of useful old people is tiny.

## Are the young wiser than the elders?

I am younger than most people here, I moved here because I'm disabled. I adore living here because I can go out and meet some of the smartest people in the world. After all, I am in the middle of the city that is developing AIâ€”San Francisco. Most of them are about 50 years younger than me.

What happened to the older people who were the mentors, who were interesting?

## Population Decline Explained

Harsh reflection on the current low birthrate in civilized nations: Why on earth would you want to have children if the end result is going to be the kind of people I live with?
