Hi Ray: Were you able to get into the chatGPT link I sent you? I'm curious to know what you think of the output.

What days are you off this week?

## 2023-06-07 The Book of Mormon

* Extremely silly, dirty and funny!
* Also evident: not written by black people or women
* Take away: even stereotypes can have lives of their own
* Take away: the power of friendship
* Daughter: power of wanting to be an economic migrant
* "Turn it off" ~ revisit the lyrics

Subject: The Blue Hotel + This evening

Hi Ray

I curating material relating to _The Blue Hotel_. See below.

A place to start is the Lit Charts page. It has a good summary of the story broken down into 28 sections - each of which has a summary and an analysis. It would be a piece of cake to turn this into a Final Draft first draft.

***

I'm looking forward to this evening - and to talking about both _The Blue Hotel_ and _The Book of Mormon_

I plan to call for an Uber at 6:30pm. I'll text you when I'm on my way.

Theo
