# 2025-05-07 Solitude

There are different kinds of solitude. One is when you're in the forest, way away from everybody. The other one is when you're in a crowd but feel all by yourself. 

It seems to me that most living things live in clusters which is safer and more rewarding, so living as a hermit is quite rare for humans. 

On the other hand, being in a crowd and feeling isolated is probably more common for humans, but might be quite rare in the plant and animal world.

Perhaps then solitude is a particularly human characteristic. 

And thus worthy of close examination, just as you are eloquently doing.
