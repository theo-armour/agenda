# 2025-06-24 Bracelet card reply


Helloo Gukui

Your card and the gift of the bracelet of the pilgrimage make me smile.

If I had received a letter like yours when I was a young man, my life might have been quite different.

I seemed to be forever in search of a connection with a woman.

Your card and the gift of the bracelet of the pilgrimage make my heart go pitter patter.

I am still a human, a man, I have a heart that has feelings, and emotions and desires.

I seem to be forever in a search for for ways of helping people connect.

Your card and the gift of the bracelet of the pilgrimage make my brain go electric.
