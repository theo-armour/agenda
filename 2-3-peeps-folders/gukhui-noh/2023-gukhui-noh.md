Moonbow received

### Window-Watcher

Cho-nong is going down
The black moon pulls at the window
Illuminate the heart rate in the crater
A fragment of a dream I dreamed of
cold cooked rice
that
There is a face that becomes abstract
window-watcher
Irregular lines build a single shape
A window that closes every few seconds
acrid plosive
Morse code that Bulmyeon sends to Bulmyeon
The candles by the window receive
mine the air
Missing for a long time in the bones of the wind
page is hanging
Let's shake as we shake
reading the shadows
organizing the imagination behind
the window goes out of the window frame
Opaque glass confines the memory of fire to the innermost part.
countless scratches

## Poet's Words

like a drop of water
continental climate
The story of the dream won't go away, your flimsy lies
I loved the mountain and came towards the ice that covered the mountaintop.
It starts to melt from an invisible place, the ice goes down
It has become a water color that does not belong to the world below.
A small wooden boat The original wood color can be seen through the cracks in the peeling paint.

There was, the heart that was carelessly bewitched is fluctuating, transparent
Stare at the bottom of a lake. A part of yourself has not sunk.
I roll up her sleeves and look down at her fingertips, the enemy of light
Closer to the floor, my heart might crack, I love the rusty bones
I worried, only met in the passage through the pipe
Like a dream we belong on no list
To hold the center of the tilted room, you from one konyeo
is shedding tears during the day when the arctic ice is cut
If you study the weather and receive it, fly to the bench in the park.
I write poetry with novels on my back. The bench is the result of countless two days
Remember the speckles in the eyes Let's read Love, a walk in the middle of summer unfolds, Cloud's expression
The faces on the streets where we wandered around are still protecting each other.
On a planet where climate zones change several times a day, I
Giving preference to you, a giant crown cloud looking down at your feet
Open the window saying that tear particles were detected in the ingredients of
Blows in a cold, dry wind

### Afterward

If you roll the pedal toward the cloud, it will come
and look at the things that are left behind at the same time
I wanted to If eternal life is given 2 water

The poem was published on the paper of the daily newspaper Shinjun Literature.line
And the twists and turns of holding a needle and pack the first book of poetry

Read and write this room on the saddle of a bicycle.

Draft: Comment on "Willow Waves"

May I post this comment?

A charming story by a non-native English speaker. Part of the charm resides in the author's choices of words, style and tense. I would not change a thing.

The story tells us about Sylvie's new life in San Francisco with English as her second language. The content created by the author reflects the text Sylvie might use if she were the author.

Here's the tricky thing - and why I would not suggest any edits. Some of the text might be considered slightly incorrect English or, on the other hand, a fresh and original take on the circumstances. I heart, for example, "Slowly, she collects the grits of sunset on her palm and walks to the bus stop."

Here is where I think Gukhui is:

Gukhui is staying with seven small people down the coast. They live in a large mansion made of gingerbread. During the day they look for gold nuggets in the deep mine in the back yard. At night they bake chocolate brownies, make jolly music and solve puzzles. Tomorrow they will ride the magic flying carpet to visit cousins near Big Sur.

;-)

What do you think Gukhui is doing?
