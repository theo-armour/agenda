Sure, here's the cleaned-up text:

---

We met at the Safeway where we both shopped. I had an upright walker, and so did he, both of the same brand. His was paid for by the VA, and mine came out of my own pocket.

We both shopped at the same time, about an hour or so before closing when the store was almost empty. That's how we got to know each other, and that's how we got to know Patrick Murphy. Here are some of the things I remember about Ray:

Ray was very particular about what he ate, perhaps obsessively so. If I remember correctly, he would buy cans of tuna and entire heads of cabbage.

Getting ready to go out for a drink or a meal at a restaurant could be done from time to time, but it would take weeks of planning, cajoling, and convincing. So, we mostly talked in Safeway or in the lobby of the building at the Golden Gateway near the Embarcadero where we both lived.

Dialogue was not always easy. I am a commie pinko leftie, and he was as conservative as you could get. But because of Ray, I read some conservative books and learned quite a bit. In particular, I read a book by Mark Levin on the Constitution that was quite engaging and opened up my mind about various types of media bias in the liberal press.

One way or another, I got to know quite a bit about his life. His childhood in Queens with a Catholic Polish father and a Jewish Polish mother, his time at Purdue, with a degree in material science, getting an MBA at Stanford, working for Bank of America, and then a startup, and finally doing bookkeeping for, if nothing else, the Roman Italian restaurant on Columbus Ave.

Somehow, I never felt that his work was actually engaging for him. He never talked about it with passion. But there were two things he did talk about very fondly.

The first was a very short period, perhaps a weekend, when he was in the Navy in Washington state. He and a colleague went to Glacier National Park and had some kind of memorable experience.

The other was the summer camp he went to, perhaps in Vermont or upstate New York. He was still in touch with some of his fellow campers and he very much wanted to create some kind of memorial or documentation of the summer camp experience.

I can't really recall any other moments like that. He was happy being a graduate of Stanford's MBA program, and had stayed in touch with some of his colleagues there.

Interestingly, in the retirement home where I now live, another resident who died last year, Mary Charlotte Roper, had worked at Bank of America, possibly as an admin or secretary to someone high up. Mary had dementia when I knew her, but she must have been a bright spark in people's lives. When I told Ray where I was living and happened to show him a brochure, he recognized her face in one ohf the photos. Apparently. he used to visit her and wanted to know if she was still alive. Unfortunately, she couldn't remember him.

Other than that, it was difficult to find what excited Ray. I think there was something psychological that was repressed or didn't work in his outlook on life. He ended up living by himself and became a Fox News watcher, a very MAGA, Trump supporter, isolated and somewhat of a hermit. It didn't need to be that way, but that's how it ended up. Here is an example that summarizes Ray's life:

In 2018, Ray decided he should have a gun. He did lots of research on which gun he wanted, but he didn't want to have a licensed gun in California due to his principles. So, Patrick and I decided to take Ray to Reno, NV, where Patrick had connections. We drove up in a rental car, enjoying big band and jazz music on the way. Ray had an encyclopedic memory of such things.

In Reno, Ray was excited to finally get a gun. He tried several, finding one that suited him. But when it came time to check out, he had forgotten his driver's license. No ID meant no gun. It was always something missing, something that didn't work out for Ray. We still had a lovely weekend, but Ray never got his gun.

This story kind of summarizes Ray's life. He could have had a wonderful, crazy life, but things always seemed to get in the way. Despite that, he would always smile when we were together, and we would talk. There was definitely a Ray there, even if the cards didn't fall in his favor.

The first was, I think, very short period, perhaps a weekend only when he was in the Navy in somewhere in the state of Washington And he and a colleague Drop just at something like glacier National Park. And had some kind of experience. That he remembered extremely fondly. Period. The other thing was that summer camp that he went to in perhaps Vermont or upstate New York We were still in touch with some of these other camp mates. And we was wanting to Create some kind of memorial or recreation or documentation of a summer camp experience Other than that, I can't really recall any of his moments. like he also must might have been happy going to Stanford, and he was very happy being a graduate of of of getting this NBA at Stanford and was in touch with some of his colleagues there One interesting aspect was that in the retirement home that I live now Another resident who died last year was Mary Charlotte Roper. Somehow. And she had worked at Bank of America, perhaps. as an admin or secretary to somebody like the chairman of the board Of Bank of America, somebody high up And Mary Charlotte Roper was when I knew her was had met a lot of mental dementia. But she must have been a bright spark in people's lives. I mean, the very, very fond memories of her when she was able. Apparently, a radio I showed Ray where I told Ray where I was living and happened to be showing him a brochure website or something. He said, oh, that's Marsha Charlotte Roper and I said, yes. And he said, I used to go come and visit her. And, you know, he wanted to know she was still alive. And we should have gotten him to come over sometime and and and talk to her. But I, I did ask her about him, and she couldn't remember. So it would probably would have been very sad if you had come over, that she had no memory But you never know. She might have recognized him as she had seen him. Anyway, so he he there must have been some little spark because apparently he would take the bus over and seen her more than once but she was probably 10 years old within. He was something like that Other than that, it was really, it's difficult to find what excited him. And I think this is the thing about Grace, that there was obviously some kind of psychological thing that we something got repressed or or something didn't work in his in his outlook in life and he ended up living by himself And then of course, he becomes AA Fox News watcher and very, very Maga, make America greater, get Trump supporter and and isolated. isolated and hermit and order and all of that stuff It didn't need to be that way, but that's how it ended up. But I think Here's the thing that you know, sort of kind of summarizes like. raised life in 2. 1018. We we Ray decided he should have a gun. And he had done lots of research about which gun he wanted and what kind of gun and what it would do and how he how he would do it. So we said, sure, OK, well, we he didn't want to go. He didn't want to have a license gun in in under California. That'll be, you know, against his principles and things like that. of some because it would be licensed and the regulation and things like that So he decided that the thing to do would be to get a gun in Nevada So we just saw Patrick and I decided that we could take Ray up to Reno, NV and stay in a hotel because Patrick likes to stand and go to Reno and he had lots of connections. It would make it easy, which actually ultimately he did. It was a piece of cake and we had a lot of fun. So one day in 2018 Patrick, Ray and me drive up, drive over to to Reno. in a in a rent a car and okay that's a little aside. We're listening to the radio and stuff like that, and it turns out that Ray knows all about big bands and jazz and things like and music like that. And yeah, they just there's a, you know, there were bits of knowledge that. Ray had you know. So encyclopedic memory of and you know that doesn't normally come out when when you talk to people but just a little person there that you know there is a brain there this this really really somebody there if you could get at it. But anyway we went on to to Reno and we had a nice time but the the morning came we had to go to the gun shop. And so there's rain in the gun shop and we, you know, he's looking at guns. There's something that he can actually. He's trying them out and. this is going to be the dream come true. He's got to own a gun and he could keep it in this apartment. And this is wonderful. So he tries our guns. He tries out the ones in with it too heavy. Could he actually hold them in the older man is difficult and guns are heavy and difficult. So then he'd find, I think he decides what he finally decides the gun he wants. And OK, so it's time to check out and buy the gun and do all the particulars Well, the gun shop owner says, well, can I see your ID And reset id And yes, I mean to buy a gun. You need to show your ID. This is a law. Ray had forgotten to bring his driver's license. He had no ID. And that is right That this, this, it was. There's always something missing, something that something that's a fail, something that didn't work out And so no gun. That he swallowed his pride. We went on. We had a lovely weekend, and so on and so forth. But Ray never got his gun. And I think that's to a certain that is Ray of the Ray could have what it could have, should have had a wonderful, crazy life. And I was all prepared, prepared for it. But somehow things came into his life. And it. his dreams never quite came true. And so be it. Because no matter what, whenever we shopped, whenever we were together, he would smile. We would talk. There was a dialog, there was a there was definitely a ray there. And just just as it were, as as the cards fell into into the, you know, in as the carts fell. he just didn't. come out in a lucky way for Ray. But that didn't stop him from smiling. And a being a nice guy.

Hi Friends of Ray

I received a voicemail from Ray at 8:20pm Thursday sent from the apartment. So for everybody listening here, Ray seems to be surviving. He is scheduled to be at the VA at 9am on Friday and he says he will take the bus. He has several appointments at the VA during the day.

I have family here and a wedding over the weekend, so my communication may be spotty. Please feel free to add any updates and words of encouragement for Ray.

Hi Ray

Thank you for your email update. It's a testament to your inner strength that the VA released you and you are home. I cannot begin to imagine the stress had gone through while having your body crumple, while being trapped in your bath, while having strangers barge in to your home while saving you. And I understand that the mind can take much time to recover from the likes of the trauma you endured.

Now that you are home, my guess is that you want to return as soon as possible to you regular routines. Even your broken elbow and the heart valve issues are not so grievous as to stop you from a desire to restart the daily routines that have served you so well to keep your mind and body together over the past few decades.

On the other hand ( not that either one of us have one handy ) as they say, "Past performance is no guarantee of future results". There may be decades of continued calm before you, There may be issue after issue in front of you. Thus you might consider using this recent very difficult experience as a wake-up call, as a call to action for a new set of routines that you are comfortable with but have a higher probability of long-term success than your current routines.

If I can give you an example of possibilities I am consider that I would like:

* Access to an ADA bathroom
* Room cleaned and laundry done
* Meals prepared or cook my own
* A bed, a desk, a chair in a private room
* Computer, phone and Internet
* Nice places to walk and be with others

In other words, I seek the abode of a monk or life in a camp or dorm. And "Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity" - Henry David Thoreau.

I can already hear you saying: "If that's what you really want, why aren't you there already?"

The reason, of course, is that I too am stuck in my own hodgepodge of little, daily rites and rituals that anchor me to a past that - quite frankly - I don't actually want to live in any more. What I do know is that  I have the intention of change. I am asking for help. I do seek assistance of others. I seek the counsel of people more experienced in the these matters than I. And the first step has been coming to the understanding that I cannot do this myself. For sure I am getting older and crazier, but I'm going to go there with a mission, a plan - and with the help and advice of my family and friends.

Ray, the next few days - weeks? - will certainly be topsy-turvy experience for you. For sure, much of the toe you will just want to tune out. But I do hope that on occasion: will you do consider what your five year plan look like? And will you share these ideas with your family and friends?
