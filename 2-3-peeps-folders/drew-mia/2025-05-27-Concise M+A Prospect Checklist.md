# Concise M&A Prospect Checklist

**How to use & interpret scores**
For each row, the buyer or seller marks “✓” if the target is met or writes the actual figure if numeric. Tally check-marks at the end: ≥ 70 % met = advance to due diligence; 50-69 % = discuss gaps; < 50 % = likely decline. Keep a copy for each prospect to enable side-by-side comparison.
