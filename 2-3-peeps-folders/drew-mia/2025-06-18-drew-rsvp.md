# 2025-06-18 Drew RSVP

Hi Drew

Hi Drew, I'm not going to make it to your place this evening. I'm very sorry. 

I love being able to say "yes", and so I think I say yes too quickly. 

But there are so many circumstances:

* As you well know, I easily drink too much in social gatherings. 
* I am a full risk. I tend to fall and hurt myself several times a year. 
* I don't know your apartment, let alone any steps to get in or out 
* When I do go out on an adventure, it takes me more than a day to get back into a regular rhythm. 

Things to keep in mind:

* Public venues are more set up for handicap access. 
* It's probably better for me to be just with one or two people. 

Things to keep in mind:

* I heart the concepts of Light DAO and HumanTech
* You share, I will give feedback

Let's meet up in the next few days and just have a chat.
