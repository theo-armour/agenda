Hi Drew

## SF Ownership

It's a start! And not a bad one at that. You should keep going with it.

I would be happy to discuss to see if I can help you with it. I have a ideas that might be useful. I'd be delighted to help get AI in on the project. ;-)

He recently sold https://wiredcraft.com/. My guess is that he received around 9 figures. 

He is looking for new ventures.

How about you leading a tour of Founders Inc? Sometime next week?
