Hi Simone


It's wonderful to hear that your schedule is keeping you occupied with good activities and allowing you to care for the people who matter to you.

I couldn't help but notice a shift in the tone of our friendship as I read your message, and it's left me feeling uncertain about what might be causing it. If I have inadvertently done something to upset you, I want to offer my sincere apologies. Your friendship means a lot to me, and I'm eager to understand any concerns or issues you may have so that I can work towards resolving them and continue nurturing our bond. Please feel free to share your thoughts with me.
