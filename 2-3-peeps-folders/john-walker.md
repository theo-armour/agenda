He died from an accident. Stairs can be hazardous.

* in 2003 I visited John and Roxie at their home in Lignieres. John showed me around FourmiLab. Later that evening He, Roxie, my three daughters and I went to watch the local fireworks display.
* I was a member of his Grognards mailing list and followed his daily hikes on Twitter.
* More recently I wass a member of his Scanalyst web forum - a place with many fascinating discussions. In December 2022, we had interchanges about AI. I amused him by creating a DALL-E image. Prompt - generated by John:
“Draw a grumpy old man holding a ladder, standing in front of a house with a leaky gutter, dropping debris on him in the style of an early autocad release drawing”

* Prompt: Write an AutoLisp routine to draw three calipers

* This past February, I visited the Scanalyst forum and was astounded by two posts:
The first was the notice of John's death.
The second post will haunt me forever The post is titled: "Three-Dimensional Modeling and Animation in the Browser". It was post relating to Three.js - an open source JavaScript Library for 3D interactive graphics in your browser. It way have been the last post John made on January 30.
The reason the post resonates is that I have been a Three.js developer since 2010. I was one of the earliest proponents of the library ans presented a number of demos for Google's WerGL meetups.
More recently I developed and maintain the Ladybug.Tools Spider gbXML Viewer. The Spider Viewer is a Three.js application that runs in the browser and is used to view and analyze building energy models. gbXML enables programs like Revit, Bentley, SketchUp to have bi-directiona communication with energy analysis programs such as OpenStudio, Trane, Ladybug Tools.

* The reason I use Three.js is because it is the closest possible follow on to AutoLisp.
* Bang out some code in one window. Hit enter. See the result pop up in the other windows
* Drawing, interaction, linear algebra, and animation are all there in a package simple enough for a simpleton developer - a amateur hacker in the original sense of the word - to understand and maintain.
**
I will always wonder: What sparked John's interest in Three.js? What was he trying to do? What was he trying to learn? What was he trying to teach? What was he trying to create?

The thought that I might have had a chance to help John Walker with his investigations is an alternate reality that will bug me forever.
