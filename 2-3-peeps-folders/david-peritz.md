Hello David,

I am interested in pursuing the topic described below. The results might be able help me and I hope you as well.

Some aspects of note regarding my approach:

I find that AI results are most refreshing and and up being most satisfactory when you start at the highest, most abstract levels and drill down into the actual issue at hand. For example in my world of computer aided design, aa good place to start might be "And let there be light" and, by golly, light happens. ;-)

An interesting challenge with Large Language Models is coming up with a one shot prompt. In other words your first prompt hits close to the mark sand subsequent prompts embellish and polish the result.

I will be pleased to share my results with you, in return for you reading Davis Graeber's and Wenger's Dawn of Everything and commenting on their assertions that

Accounts of human history
1. Simply aren't true
2. Have dire political implications
3. Make the past needlessly dull ~ Actually more playful

Suggestion for a one-shot prompt:

Please describe a process that enables university professors to transform their PowerPoint slides and recorded Zoom sessions into articles suitable for publishing on Substack and other long-read websites.

The text from the slides becomes the section headings
The text from the transcription becomes the section bodies
The images from the slides are inserted in the appropriate sections
The text is edited for correct spelling and grammar
The text is edited for reading by university graduates (or any other stated audience type)
Where suitable, hyperlinks are included
When available, references and bibliography are included
A tl;dr is created and added at the beginning
Suitable and relevant tags are devised
Links for re-posts to other sites such as X or Instagram are included

> Finally, David has an emerging research interest in the philosophy of aging, specifically the question of how we maintain vitality and the respect of ourselves as well as others across the entirety of life, especially in light of the current lifespan revolution.

At your talk at Heritage on the Marina on August 26, you presented a host of issues that may serve to confound life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

When asked what could be done to alter the course of events, you suggested "regulate media"

I am totally with you that media is the disruptor, but I have difficulty imagining ways that media could be regulated.

Rather than turning way, might it be fruitful to to examine the current state of media and identify where things might be un-dissembled?

What are three (five? seven? ) global trends that currently appear to underlie major shifts in the way people collaborate?

Is this a thing: Interpersonal communication is shifting from media that involves writing, silence, static printed text content to media that produces oral, aural, reactive and graphical content. Peeps like Marshal McLuhan and Zeynep Tufekci may be sources of inspiration.

The ethos of conservation is getting a lot of press these days. We read about Sustainable Development Goals, Effective Altruism, the Long Now. Are they fashion? Or do they have traction?

If you are interested, I will be please to double-click into any of these topics over a periods of several weeks and report
