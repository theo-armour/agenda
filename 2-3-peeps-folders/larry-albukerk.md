Hi Larry

I hope you and your good family are all well. All is well on my side of the street.

Can you advise me on the following - which I understand is inline with your expertise.

I have been offered pre-ipo shares in OpenAI by Sand Hill Road Technologies Fund. I have invested in a lot of startups but never in this way.

I have been an OpenAI user since its inception. I would consider this as a long term investment - and not just a speculation.  I am financially qualified to do so.

Could you kindly suggest someone I might talk to about this kind of offer and suggest the questions I should be asking?

Cheers,

Theo

Theo - welcome from Greece.

Honestly I would stay far away from those guys. I also think that with the mark up and everything it will be over 100bln valuation. I can give you my opinion as well on competition, etc., but I don’t know if I’m right I would just rather invest directly in a public company, it would be much less risky. There are many unknown risks for example, do they actually own the stock, have they re-sold it many times, what is the actual price? You will not learn this until it either has a liquidity event or it is a zero unless they send you all the underlying documents. I also have not heard good things about these guys. I don’t know why they would not put their bios on the website? The examples they put for past deals are also very misleading. They should give a full list of all companies They invested in prices and amounts if they want to be transparent.

I personally would never invest with them and I am not a fan of openAI at that price. Amazing product and it will probably go up but lots of risk and very illiquid not to mention these things are always a headache, getting K-1, etc..

Best
Larry

Hi Larry

Thank you for your good advice. I will stay away from this one. Your final point made me smile - and is the real deal killer: headaches from trying to get K-1s. ;-)

Since you are in Greece, I have gifted you a copy of The Iliad in a new translation by Emily Wilson that is a fun read. I hope you enjoy it.

Hi Larry

I am delighted with the thought of the Challenge Athletes Foundation event on the 10th. Thank you for thinking of me.

But, sadly, the reality is that I am too much of a fall risk. If I stand still too long, a leg tends to buckle and I fall. Guess what happens when you start having engaging conversations with people? You talk and stand still.

Also I am recovering from a UTI and taking an antibiotic - so no alcohol until after the 10th.

May I propose an alternative plan? You and your family become my eyes and ears. I draft 5 to 10 questions for all of you to observe and report back on or to inquire about.

Sometime after the 10th, we meet for coffee and juices on Chestnut Street and you and your family report back and tell me what you saw and heard.

## Questions

I have unusual disabilities. I am a partial paraplegic from the waist down and my left hand was amputated. Having disabilities to both upper and lower extremities is quite rare. Even so, I will be interested to hear about the latest advances in sports equipment for the disabled. I have a few questions:

* There are many types of disabilities: mental, sensory and physical. What types of disabilities are generally being catered for?
* Anybody catering to invisible disabilities - blindness, deafness and incontinence?
* Anybody catering to people with hand amputations?
* Any exhibits with exoskeletons - frames that you can attach to your body to aid mobility?
* Any upright walkers? See https://www.amazon.com/ELENKER-Rollator-Mobility-Backrest-Armrests/dp/B07W43JTDG/ref=sr_1_2_sspa
* Are there any digital monitoring devices that do not require a wrist? Putting on a watch when you have one hand is a challenge.
* Adaptive clothing
I Sometimes I think about getting a tricycle, but with the last one I had, I fell twice. I also once had a recumbent four wheeler, but it was too low to be seen by cars and trucks. I am not sure if I should try again. Anybody have any suggestions?


 I will be attending an exhibition of sports equipment for the disabled. I am interested in learning about the latest advances. What should I look for? What questions should I ask?
