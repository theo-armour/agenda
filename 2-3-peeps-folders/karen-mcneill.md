Hi Karen 

I hope you are doing well. 

I've just had a fresh look at your LinkedIn profile and noticed that you've established a family and business history consultancy. 

I was thinking of you in particular because of a particular aspect of documenting a life, a family or a business so as to leave the effort as a legacy. 

Specifically, I'm thinking about clients who already have rich archives—extensive documentation, photos, videos, and records—that could be transformed into comprehensive digital legacies.

Thus, I am not talking about the people make an hour-long video or ghostwriting your book. Nor am I talking about spending hours in front of a computer entering data. 

But I am talking about people that can manage assembling existing data and prepare it for creating a digital legacy. 

And in order to get this idea going, I would like to introduce you to my friend, Dan Thomson, author of these two books:

The Digital Afterlife: Exploring Mind Uploading

Immortality in a Digital Age: How we can live forever as digital copies of ourselves, and the benefits and issues that may come with it

https://www.amazon.com/Immortality-Digital-Age-ourselves-benefits/dp/1700712934/ref=sr_1_7

More to the point, Dan is founder and CEO of Sensay, a company that is building a platform for digital immortality.

Given your expertise in preserving family and business histories, and Dan's work in digital legacy technology, I think you two would have a lot to talk about.

Would you be interested in an introduction?
