Hamas: terrorist:nothing admirable

Israeli:

Anti-semantism

Jews <> Israeli Gov

No meaningful solution without two-state

I. cannot destroy Hamas.

Campaign: at what cost?

Killing civilians help hamas get recruits - radicalized

five years later: Hamas is more powerful

competing narratives /

what could lead to peace?

David: out with Netenyahu ~ cowardly caculator

Gaza: size of Manhattan

I: hunger and disease as a method of war

I: no longer invincible therefore must go to war

I: jews will never be helpless again therefore must punish: out crazy the crazies

75% of buildings damaged; 15K deaths ~ mostly women & children

tunnel digging was best job for young men

tunnel have issues: need air, pumps etc

Why did I. get into this? What is end game?

Why did I. fail?

I. calculated wrong; analysis failure

Thought Hamas liked getting money too much

Oct 7: I. military redeployed to West Bank

politically expedient to ignore hamas so as to harm PLA

to prevent Palestinian state

divide the Palestinians, no state for Palestinians

I. religionization of politics; rise of Orthodox

cost of I. occupying gaza was too high

I. Must learn to live with gaza

gaza: open air prison; no economy; no jobs; no hope

hamas: the hand that feeds

"Second Nakba" - occupation of West Bank ~ deliberate

Hamas is not popular; less than 30% support; not trusted; corrupt

terrorist organization end because they change their pursuits - not through killing ~ see IRA

rebuild Gaza with I's assistance; economic modernity

need people to people interaction

dismantle the WB settlements;

only path is not just terrorism

some orgs threatened by peace therefore suicide bombers

Kathy: Why US supporting N?
