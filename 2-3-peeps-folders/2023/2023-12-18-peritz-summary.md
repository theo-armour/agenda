# 2023-12-18 Peritz Summary

## Quick Recap

David discussed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, emphasizing the futility of war and its disproportionate impact on civilians. He criticized the Israeli government's leadership and prioritization of political gain, and highlighted the escalating humanitarian crisis in a densely populated region. David also discussed the challenges posed by Hamas's tunnel network and strategic redeployment of resources, as well as the economic and social conditions in Gaza and the West Bank.

## Israel-Hamas Conflict Unresolvable: David

David discussed the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, expressing their belief that neither side can achieve their stated goals without leading to future wars. They pointed out that Hamas's objective of reclaiming all territory currently occupied by Israel is unrealistic and has come at a high cost, including thousands of deaths. Similarly, Israel's objective of destroying Hamas is also deemed unrealistic. David also highlighted the disproportionate impact of the conflict, with two-thirds to three-quarters of those killed being women and children, and not militants. They argued that for each civilian killed, multiple recruits join the terrorist organization, which could lead to a more radicalized population in the future. They concluded that neither side can win this war.

## Israel's Future and Government Criticism

David discussed the need to shift focus from past events to potential future solutions for peace, especially in light of a recent traumatic event in Israel. They criticized the current government, specifically referring to Benjamin Netanyahu, for what they perceived as a lack of effective leadership and prioritization of political gain over the release of hostages and national interests. David also emphasized the necessity for accountability and change within the government.

## Humanitarian Crisis and Israeli Security

David discussed the escalating humanitarian crisis in a densely populated region, with over 80% of the population homeless due to lack of access to food, water, and medication. They highlighted that the situation has led to a rapid spread of disease and has been termed a "humanitarian nightmare" by international organizations. David also touched upon the Israeli military's belief that they must respond to protect their civilians, citing a recent surge in violence and the erosion of their perceived security. They traced the history of Israel's existence, noting that its neighbors had a foreign policy aimed at eradicating Israel for the first 25 years, but that perspective has shifted over the past 50 years as Israel has established itself and formed alliances with some Arab states.

## Israel's Military Response to Hamas Threats

David discussed Israel's military response to threats from Hamas, emphasizing the need to defend its territory. They explained that while Israel can't eliminate Hamas due to its support within the population, it must fight a war it can't win. David also addressed the issue of civilian casualties, highlighting that Hamas hides its operations in civilian areas, but this doesn't justify disregarding civilian lives in retaliation. They ended by showing a diagram illustrating the disproportionate impact on Palestinian civilians, particularly women. David welcomed questions and comments throughout their discussion.

## Israel's Challenges in Combating Hamas Tunnels

David discussed Israel's military campaign against Hamas, emphasizing the challenges posed by Hamas's tunnel network and its strategy of blending into the civilian population. They noted that Israel has been successful in disrupting the tunnel networks, but at a considerable cost. David also highlighted the difficulty of Israel's mission, describing it as an asymmetrical war due to the differing capabilities of the military and the terrorist organization. They pointed out that Israel failed to anticipate Hamas's aggression on October 7, which they believes led to significant loss of life. David suggested that Israel could have taken steps to prevent the violence, but did not elaborate on what those steps might have been.

## Israel's West Bank Resource Redeployment Strategy

David discussed Israel's strategic redeployment of resources from the South to the West Bank in anticipation of a holiday and potential conflicts. They described the situation as a colonial enterprise aimed at expelling Palestinians from their remaining territory. David emphasized that the expansion of Israel's de facto territory was often fueled by conflicts instigated by Israeli settlers. They also pointed out that the current government's policy has been to undermine the Palestinian authority and strengthen Hamas, which they saw as more amenable to negotiation. David suggested that the strategy could eventually lead to a situation where Palestinians either give up and move elsewhere or accept permanent apartheid.

## Palestine's Youth and Organizations' Challenges

David discussed the situation in Palestine, focusing on the challenges faced by the Palestinian youth and the role of organizations like Hamas. They emphasized that the current approach, which they believes is unsustainable, has led to a radicalization of anti-Israeli elements. David also touched upon the transformation of Israeli society into a more religious and right-wing entity, which they argued has contributed to the current crisis. They mentioned the economic hardships in Gaza, likening it to an open-air prison, and stressed the need for a different approach that allows Palestinians to have control of their territory. They concluded by expressing hope for a future where Israel can learn to live with Palestinian autonomy.

## Palestinian Economy and Politics Discussed

David discussed the economic and social conditions in Gaza and the West Bank, focusing on the high unemployment rate and low per capita income. They explained that many Palestinians support Hamas, not out of ideological agreement, but because it provides their only source of income. David also discussed the Israeli settlements in the West Bank, stating that their growth is part of a strategy to make the region uninhabitable for Palestinians. They added that violence, including killings and injuries, is a common occurrence, with substantial military support. David concluded by stating that, until October 7, Hamas was not popular within the West Bank, with less than 30% of the population supporting it, but it was on its way to becoming a non-responsive, non-responsive organization.

## Suppression vs. Negotiation: David's Insights on Terrorism

David discussed the futility of military suppression of terrorist organizations, citing the Sri Lankan fight against the Tamil Tigers and the Israeli military's approach to Gaza as examples. They argued that terrorist groups typically end their violent campaigns not through suppression, but by changing their minds about the effectiveness of terrorism. They suggested that Israel could learn from past successful efforts to change the strategies of the African National Congress in South Africa and the Irish Republican Army. David also emphasized the need for rebuilding in Gaza, including economic modernization and improved access to Israel's job market. They stressed the importance of Israelis and Palestinians interacting and humanizing each other, as well as the necessity of dismantling Israeli settlements. Finally, they called for patience, fortitude, and determination from both sides to maintain peaceful negotiations, rather than resorting to violence.

## Israeli-Palestinian Relations and U.S. Involvement

David discussed the complex and contentious issue of Israeli-Palestinian relations, focusing on the role of the United States. They highlighted the criticism of Israeli tactics, yet the continued support, funding, and provision of weapons by the U.S. They also touched upon the potential implications of a future Donald Trump presidency. David further discussed the different perceptions of Israel depending on one's experience during different eras, suggesting that Joe Biden's views might be outdated. They concluded by confirming their plans to return for another discussion in the following month.
