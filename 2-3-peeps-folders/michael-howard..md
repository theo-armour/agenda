TSP's archivist, Jennifer Dwight, is a quiet reserved person I would guess in her 50's. As Trinity Church, the "Mother Church of the Pacific" has been around for 175 years, there is a lot of history, and having someone like Ms Dwight to mine it is a gift to the parish and the city. Considering the historical social associations of both the Heritage and Trinity, there are indeed likely connections.
