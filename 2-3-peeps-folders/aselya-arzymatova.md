## “Somewhere to Belong”

I’m searching for a place to belong,
Maybe my body’s enough on its own.
I want to love myself fully,
Embrace every flaw and imperfection.
Let me stay young at heart,
A kid forever, finding joy in life.

Where does my heart wander
When you’re not by my side?
I wait for the breath
To fill my lungs once more.

It’s okay, I’m here now,
This space holds its purpose,
It’s meant to be,
By some magic, nature’s plan, or so I believe.
Every day I have a reason,
I’ll do my best and let go of the rest,
Grateful for each breath
That a higher power has gifted

Where does my heart wander
When you’re not by my side?
I wait for the breath
To fill my lungs once more.
