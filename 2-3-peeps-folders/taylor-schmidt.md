Hi Taylor

You have a ton of energy, drive and enthusiasm. I am impressed.

Nonetheless, I am having difficulty figuring out how I can be of help to you.

On one hand I see an AEC market being bombarded with AI solutions that are shipping now, fit into existing workflows and are being used by real people to solve real problems.

On the other hand I see you with a company that is still in the process of defining its product and its market.

I do understand that you seek introductions to financial backers and potential customers. I am not sure I can help you there because of the way I work. Normally I write an email to both parties with either a PDF of a detailed business plan or a link to a demo. I don't have either of those in a form that
feels ready to share people with deep AEC acumen.

Fingers crossed: You have good luck with angel risk-takers which I am no longer one of.

On my side, I am not sure what to do next. I am open to suggestions.

Theo

Hi Taylor

At long last, My "AI in AEC" curated collection of bookmarks is ready for your inspection. It is in two parts:

The first part is in Raindrop.io - a bookmarking service that syncs across devices. It is a nice way to save and organize links to web pages, videos, images and other content.

https://raindrop.io/TheoA/ai-aec-35784921

The second part is two pages in a folder in my personal online know-how repository.

* https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#13-technology-applied-sciences/computing/artificial-intelligence/ai-apps/ai-aec.md
* https://theo-armour.github.io/pages/#13-technology-applied-sciences/computing/artificial-intelligence/ai-apps/ai-aec-journal.md

The first page is a Readme file that explains the links in the Raindrop collection. The second tracks my current observations regarding the state of the art of AI in AEC.

Let me know if this is all too confusing. I will be working on getting everything visible in Raindrop.

I am looking forward to your comments and suggestions.
