## 1. When you were learning the math; writing programs in BASIC I know you were fairly young— would you say you were about six or seven. Maybe younger? Maybe older? What age?

My first computer language was Fortran. I learned it at summer school in 1966 at Syracuse University. I thoroughly enjoyed the course. In some ways I should have continued in computer science but in the fall I started at the School of Architecture. 

## 2. What year did you stop working for Autodesk? What year did you move to San Francisco?

I stopped working for Autodesk in 1998 while living in Mill Valley. I moved to San Francisco in 2000. 

## 3. You mentioned one of the good reasons for moving to the Heritage on the Marina from the Golden Gate Apartments was that it was during the COVID (2020) and it was risky and dangerous, living on the 20th Floor.  Could you further explain what risky and difficult was for you at this time?

Living on the 20th floor meant riding in elevators for quite a while. I didn't know who had been in the elevator, I did not know who was going to be in the elevator. Many people were choosing not to wear masks. 

Thankfully, there was a very long hall and I could walk him down many times a day and get my exercise that way. 

I was also afraid of what would happen if I had an accident or illness living all by myself and having nobody to take care of me, especially since I'm already quite disabled. 

## 4. After you stopped working for Autodesk, was there another employer— or did your work consist of working on your own, consultancies, website design etc.

After leaving Autodesk, try to become an angel investor and a technical founder. I was involved with a number of startups - 20+ - all of which pretty much failed or had limited good outcomes from me. Though some individuals did go on to prosper later on. 

In about 2010, I stopped trying to start companies and instead worked with open-source software, having great success with three.js and Ladybug tools. 

## 5. You mentioned that you were a member on the Board of Advisors Peggy Guggenheim Collection and that was not a pleasant experience.  Let me know of other boards you have served on (or are serving on now). I don’t need a long list— just a few is fine.

Actually, being on the Guggenheim board was one of the most pleasant experiences of my life. I went to some of the most amazing palaces and attended extraordinary parties and was invited to do wonderful things for ten years. I was in close contact with wonderful billionaires and their families.

Most importantly, I learned a few things about myself. 

I'm not really a lifestyle person, I'm a getting things done person. 

Most of the people I was in contact with, though being very nice, had made their money long ago and were more devoted to their lifestyle than to solving problems. 

I often think of rejoining, but I'd rather do things that give me utility and agency. 

Boards I have served on include:

* Solon Housing Association ~ London ~ 1976-1978
* Stratton Design Ltd DBA CAD-Asia ~ Hong Kong ~ 1984-1992
* Sports Association for the Physically Handicapped ~ Hong Kong ~ 1982-1987
* Peggy Guggenheim Collection ~ Venice, Italy ~ 2001-2011
* Websight Design ~ San Francisco ~ 2016-2024

This year, I wil proabablt be elected to the Board of Heritage on the Marina.

## 6.  In the mid-2020s you were invited to present your latest efforts at events organized by Google to promote WebGL. Please give me the detail on “your latest efforts.”

In 2010, I became involved with the software that you can see here: https://threejs.org/. I was one of the first people to use it and I was able to help get it into the hands of many people.

I was invited by Google to participate in a number of seminars showing off the capabilities of this new delightful 3D software application.

## When you are hard at work, designing, developing, building— do you use voice on computer or get things done using your one hand.  Do you have a prosthetic? Is Artificial Intelligence involved? If so, please describe.  

I am dictating my answers to your question using voice to text. In general, I am using voice-to-text applications more and more frequently. 

I do have a prosthetic device I can attach to the stump on my left arm, but I use it rarely. It's not particularly comfortable and of no great use to me since I'm so well adapted to living with one hand a stump.


## 8.  When you were participating in the Triathlon did you do more than swimming? Triathlons include three activities (also running and cycling). Or was there an exception?

I just did the swim in the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon. I was awarded first prize for the best disabled swim. and I was the only one not wearing a wetsuit. 

## 9.  I got that your desire to go to China was driven out of your curiosity to learn about communism and the revolution.  Was I correct; do you want to add anything here? Did you travel to China with your wife and family?

I wanted to be part of making something good happen, and in many ways, I did, but not the revolution I thought it was going to be. Not the socialist revolution, but the revolution in getting China to go from a pre-industrial economy to a fully fledged industrial economy. 

## 10. What is Centenary of Heritage?  Could you give me more info on your participation—you mentioned the San Francisco Mayor—please talk about this.
