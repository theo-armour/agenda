# 0 Agenda for Myra Krieger

Hi Jan and Myra

I'm sorry for the slow reply. I guess it shows that Heritage on the Marina enables me to be as busy and as productive as ever. ;-)

I will be delighted to introduce Shirley Lowe or anybody to Patti Gallagher and Bob Connolly, the team members that talk to prospective residents.

And I'm always pleased to give a tour myself. But I am biased. Moving here was perhaps one of the best decisions I ever made.

Theo

Until this weekend that I get to tackle them, because I'm working on the April heritage happenings and also on a special edition relating to the 100th anniversary of the Julian Morgan building.
