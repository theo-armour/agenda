A while ago I had dinner with people I have never met before - having been invited by good mutual friends.

The family we visited live in Tiburon in what I termed an Eichler Home https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Eichler.

Wikipedia describes an Eichler homes thusly:

>Eichler homes are examples of Modernist architecture that has come to be known as "California Modern", and typically feature glass walls, post-and-beam construction, and open floorplans in a style indebted to Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe. Eichler home exteriors featured flat and/or low-sloping A-framed roofs, vertical 2-inch pattern wood siding, and spartan facades with clean geometric lines. One of Eichler's signature concepts was to "bring the outside in", achieved via skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows with glass transoms looking out on protected and private outdoor rooms, patios, atriums, gardens, and swimming pools. Also of note is that most Eichler homes feature few, if any, front-facing (i.e., street-facing) windows; instead house fronts have either small, ceiling-level windows or small, rectangular windows with frosted glass. Many other itectural designs have large windows on all front-facing rooms.

>The interiors had numerous unorthodox and innovative features for the time period including: exposed post-and-beam construction; tongue and groove decking for the ceilings following the roofline; concrete slab floors with integral radiant heating; lauan (Philippine mahogany) paneling; sliding doors for rooms, closets, and cabinets; and typically a second bathroom located in the master bedroom. Later models introduced the distinctive Eichler entry atriums, an open-air, enclosed entrance foyer designed to further advance the concept of integrating outdoor and indoor spaces.

> Eichler homes were airy and modern in comparison to most of the mass-produced, middle-class, postwar homes built in the 1950s. At first, potential home buyers, many of whom were war-weary ex-servicemen and women seeking convention rather than innovation, were resistant to the innovative homes.

The family had recently moved in. They are renting for six months with an option to buy.

My architectural background, my joy in being in a California Modern house, my eye for detail were called into action. We spent several hours inspecting the property.

My guess is that the house was designed by Anshen & Allen - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshen_%26_Allen. RThe structure is mostly original but some new aspects added: the carport turned into a garage, floor to ceiling glazing adjacent to the front door, the kitchen was redone though the original terrazzo floor is still there and so on.

I had a ton of fun, observing, remarking and suggesting. It was an evening of delight. Almost immediately I wanted to write an email thanking the family for such an entertaining evening., but I did not. And now I am writing an article and not just tossing off a message. Why???

This article is a way of exploring the hesitation.

In its current state, the house look like it could be lived in for a few years very happily without major refurbishment or repairs needed. On the other hand given its location and given a good chunk of money and design thinking it could re-jigged in a quite special property with a big ticket price.

I think this possibility of choice is what got me to thinking. Which choice would I want? Which way would I recommend?

I have in 33 places for, say, nine months or more. In a good number of these places, I had complete control of over the nature of the space. I would like to describe a state of being. Let's call it "Love of House".

Sometimes daily life sucks, so you spend time making your house nice
Sometimes you have become so attached to a house that your house is you.
Sometimes your house needs so much maintenance that you are your house'e guard
Some how, in some way, for some people, ur house becomes a significant part of who you are. For these people Love of House is a part of who the are.

Ths is not true for all people.

Some people revel in buying a house, doing it up, flipping it and moving on to the next project.
Some people are happy renting and moving where ever and whenever.
Some people are houseless

This article is about the Love of House crowd.

The first thing to note about Love of house is that it can become an addiction. Here is a quote for which I have no source "Never invest in a company when the CEO is building a new headquarters". The explanation is that the CEO will be spending so much time looking after his new baby that his eye on the business is distracted and the business will suffer. Love of Home sucks up resources in terms of money and time. Maybe you are mowing th lawn; maybe you are commenting on the landscape architect's scheme.

Will Love of Home prevent you from moving to Chicago or wherever to take up the job of yor dreams because you are midway in a two year building process? Will Love of Home mean you don't take your children to visit their cousins in Australia? Will Love of home mean that you are stuck there until the day you die there?

Being an architect I have had Love oHome in a number of places. "Parting is such sweet sorrow". I was invested in each place. Each place had its failings. Each new place was exciting.

So I think a good thing to discuss
"how much love are we going to give this house?"
In length of stay: Is this a three year house? A ten year house? A life time house?
"how much are we going to invest in this house? In dollars are we doing this out of salary and credit cards. are we taking out a loan for the work, Are we betting our financial future on making a really good profit?
"How much time?" Wil we be taking the kids kayaking? Will we take Grandma to Paris? Will we go skiing? Will we be able excel at our day jobs?

Wait there'a more

Apart from a personal commitment, this house in question also offers an architectural dilemma. Anshen & Allen are not Frank Lloyd Wright, but they and their building have much cachet in this era.California Modern is a sought after style and people are willing to to pay a premiums to acquire such properties. In many projects the intent is to replicate the entire style of the original project down to the last detail. There can be a good premium for projects like this. Or you can consider these projects as being Extreme Love of Home.

There is a good way of exploring this. Locate the original architect's drawings and marketing material associated with the project. The planning department may have the plans. The library may have articles relating to to the original designs. If the original project had documented sizzle, if the original plans display a cool intent, then rolling back the years can be considered.

If the original project was kind of anonymous, the forget the past. The idea is to transform the old bits of sticks into the dernier cri. "Damn the torpedoes; Full speed ahead! Architectural Digest: here we come!"


Now we come to the tricky part: the conclusion

Twenties, before the babies even  until young children: Love your fixer-upper, self-build
Thirties, middle age: with children then mind the children - no children then build
Forties,fifties, children in college: build
Sixties +; Tweak or sell and start again
Seventies: prepare to age well

People talk about many things they love: skiing, cooking, the symphony, TV shows and so on. But how much do they talk about the place where they spend most or their time, money and consciousness?

In my dream utopia

Every five years you move
Love of home becomes love of village/cohort/tribe
Building becomes crazy fun new stuff - 3d printed / editable / fashionable
