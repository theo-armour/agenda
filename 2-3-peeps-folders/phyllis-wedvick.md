I enjoy your evening messages.  A gift.

If Fornaio was the favorite place for dinner for Peer and me.  We often sat at the end of the bar and shared grilled salmon.  Peer loved pasta of any type.

For years, we would go.  When Peer and I had more money we would also drink wine.

No, I have not been to Avenidas lately but rather prefer a tiny cafe on Ramona Street called Marvel.  Four little tables and fabulous pastry, coffee, and tea.

Today was an up and down day but I managed to survive.

>> I enjoy your evening messages.  A gift.

And I enjoy the writing from my end as well.

And yet I wonder how and why it came to happen. But not too much. And just let it happen.

Looks like yummy calories! ;-)


## 2025-07-17

Are you hanging out at Avenidas these days?

I had lunch with my "cousin" Phillip at Perry's on Union Street — a good long uphill walk for me. When he lived in Palo Alto, we had lunch at Il Fornaio.


## 2025-07-16

I have not felt well for the past two days.  Too much anxiety exhausts me.

Today, I did go to storage to find my way to the end of the project.  Boxes of books are left.

Accommodating is an odd word.

>>I have not felt well for the past two days.  Too much anxiety exhausts me.

It’s very understandable. Anxiety is so draining.

>>Today, I did go to storage to find my way to the end of the project.  Boxes of books are left.

I find going to storage is so tricky because all the memories keep jumping out. It can be difficult to get things done. I hope you were able to make progress.

>> Accommodating

To me :accommodating" means being willing to understand, accept, and adapt to each other's differences in order to create harmony and mutual respect. It involves patience, flexibility, and effort to meet the other’s needs while valuing and honoring each other's unique perspectives.

## 2025-07-15

Fingers crossed you had a good and got out and chatted with some interesting people.

Tonight I had dinner with one of my fellow residents who is very conservative, a faithful Trump supporter and basically dislikes all government. Somehow she and me, the lefty progressive, always seem to get along. We almost never agree on anything and yet somehow keep the dialog going. I don't really understand how we actually do this. I guess somehow we are "accommodating" of each other but I can't actually put my finger on what "accommodating" actually means.



## 2025-07-14

Theo,

Here are a few thoughts:

Your family had wealth.  Peer's family did not although he attended St. Paul's and graduated.  My family did not.

The only time that I had financial security was when I married my first husband.  As an engineer, he had an excellent job and always did well.

When you have wealth, you might not realize that more than luck is involved when you are older.  From what you write, I sense arrogance and a judgmental attitude.

To have $100,000 scammed has nothing to do with luck.

---

~~Your message makes me ?? I not at all able to come up with what a constructive response might be.~~

~~Can you help me?~~

You're right that my perspective comes from a fortunate place. I wasn't judging Mal - I was criticizing how our class reacts to real need. But I hear how it landed, especially knowing how much Peer cared about him.

## 2025-07-13

Theo--Peer thought of Mal Calder often and cared about him.  What you wrote was not kind.

I attended and graduated from Mount Holyoke College.  Many classmates had graduated from boarding schools with elite names.  I did not. I did not spend my summers in Europe.

Having had many unfortunate financial crises in my own life, and having received help from many, I would not judge Mal.  I have my own worries and received help from many sources.  Peer did as well.

Maybe you never needed to ask for financial help.  From what Peer told me about your family, I realize that you did not have this kind of need.

---

>> What you wrote was not kind.
>>

I absolutely agree. People who attended posh boarding schools tend to have curious sentiments about a number of topics — particularly about wealth and lack of it. Our class is no different.

Looking at my message, I do not get a sense that I was judging Mal. What I was judging yesterday and today was the class of '65 as a group.

>> Maybe you never needed to ask for financial help.
>>

I have looked to investors on several occasions for financial help, but that is not what you were looking for, I guess. On the other hand, I have been seriously scammed three times, once for over a hundred thousand. Finding out that your "very good friend" is not a friend is debilitating.

I have also worked very hard, saved a good amount of money, put money aside for contingencies, planned my life quite diligently and, in the whole, been very very lucky.

All humans have deep needs of one sort or another.

## 2025-07-12

How funny.

I used to walk along Chestnut years ago.  I remember a music box store.

My days are odd.  Today I brought cupcakes to Faith at the bookstore.  We sat in the very back of the store--many little rooms--and drank tea and chatted for almost two hours.  Part of the conversation was about aging.  Faith's husband is 84--14 years older than she is.

I spoke to Marie by telephone for an hour--she lives near where we both were born and grew up in houses next door to each other.

Somehow, despite crying much this morning, the day became less lonely.

Did you know Mal Calder?  He was a close friend of Peer.

---

>> Mal Calder
>>

The last time saw Mal was Either at our graduation or at the party that Nat Prentice gave a few days after.

There was another encounter, however: A few years ago, Mal started messaging the SPS 65 email group pleading poverty and requesting financial support. As you might imagine, this is not the thing to do when returning to the playground of the elite.

My effort for the day:

French Wine and Cheese Tasting: The Menu

https://heritage-happenings.github.io/print.html#https://heritage-happenings.github.io/Blog/2025/07-july/2025-07-12-French-Wine-and-Cheese-Tasting/French-Wine-and-Cheese-Tasting.md

Two aspects:

1. I've organized yet another event, just because the staff are under-equipped and the residents are too old.
2. The website for this page is also my effort: Trying to make it all work on the phones of people in their late nineties

## 2025-07-11

How is Karl?  How are you?

---

Last night I was working something and completely forgot to send a message. So it goes.

Karl is still under observation at Kaiser. Lillemor is more under control and she has not asked me to cover for her.

Last night I was walking back from an event on Chestnut Street. A group of perhaps eight or ten young people, all talking with each other, were coming toward me. Just as they were passing by, I heard a woman say, "this idiotic man from New York." So I blurted out "Like me!"  And they all cracked up. Fifteen seconds of impromptu street theater. Made my evening.

## 2025-07-11

This seems difficult. I don't know. When Peer received treatment at Kaiser, I would sometimes go also. Infusions and transfusions-not pleasant memories. Cancer is awful but Peer would pretend to himself and his sons that all was not a problem. Honestly, I do not miss either son.

---

## 2025-07-09

There was a knock on my door around 8 am this morning. My friend Lillemor told me that her husband Karl was being taken to Kaiser. She was not fit to go, would I go?

After hesitating, I said yes, and so I spent the morning by his hospital bed. He was having internal bleeding and needed a blood transfusion. He has stage 4 prostate cancer. He took it all very stoically. Eventually, I went home, and Lillemor and a friend of hers came to be with Karl.

I like Karl, and yet I have no deep feelings for this man. So it is all a strange, very grey experience. Nonetheless, I do admire his stoicism and equanimity. I hope I would behave in a similar manner if it were me.

## 2025-07-08

I woke up this morning with the same panic and the sense that Peer is missing that has been present since he entered the hospital and then died.  This was never supposed to happen or that is what I believed.

Your message has warmth and understanding of the challenge I face each day.  I am grateful.

---

What you believed then, what you understand now, What was supposed to happen, what didn't happen, what did happen.

I can feel all of these thoughts running through your mind. And then I can see you getting outside  of your thoughts and and quietly observing your thoughts running around. And then, poof, your are transported back inside and it all gets complicated again.

---

The panic when you wake up, that sense of him being missing - I can only imagine how that hits you each morning. It's so hard when your heart hasn't caught up to what your mind knows.

You're right that this wasn't supposed to happen. That belief made sense then, and the shock of it still makes sense now.

I'm thinking of you as you navigate each day with this impossible absence.

## 2025-07-07

>> Very tough night with little sleep.  Not much to say or write this morning.
>>

---

I'm sorry to hear this. From what you had been writing recently, the intensity and duration of acute grief seemed to have diminished. Looking around the Internet, I see that episodes of acute grief can last 6 to 12 months or more. And that the periods of grief are to be expected and are normal and that triggers and onsets are unpredictable.
Me being a perpetual optimist — I'm always looking for the bright side, my brain comes up with this thought:
The only people who can truly grieve for another person are sensitive, caring and loving people
So I hope you are not blaming or criticizing yourself and deal with life as you would with a physica pain in a non judgmental way

---

Clause:

I'm so sorry you had such a rough night. I know you've been having some better stretches lately, so these hard waves must feel especially difficult when they hit.

From what I've read, grief really does come in these unpredictable waves, even months down the road. There's no timeline for it, and those sleepless nights can just knock you sideways without warning.

You know me - always trying to find something hopeful to hold onto. And here's what strikes me: the depth of your grief is really just the other side of how deeply you loved. Only people with big, caring hearts feel loss this intensely.

Please be gentle with yourself today. You wouldn't judge yourself for limping if you had a broken leg, and this kind of pain deserves the same compassion. Your heart is doing exactly what it needs to do.

Yes.  My mother used to use that phrase.

What do you do on weekends?

>> Yes.  My mother used to use that phrase.

For me, it's an alternative to "So It Goes".

>> What do you do on weekends?

I think the last time I had to clock in was around 1979.

So it's been something like "whatever works 24/7" ever since.

Luckily, I am the sort of person that creates content.
And, there's always room for more.

## 2025-07-05

When I am less tired.

It turns out that most of the effort I put in the last two days into building a website for Heritage was not worth the effort. This happens from time to time when you are programming something complicated that takes a good number of days to complete. Some things you try are just wrong. Not a happy camper here. And this too shall pass.

## 2025-07-04

I'm quite certain this event will be full, but most any day is open for for a meal and a visit.

Dinner with Margaret Johnson, who is 101, and her son, daughter, and grandson. Margaret is a frequent contributor to the newsletter. I have a meal with her two or three times a week. It was great to have people my age along with her.

## 2025-07-02

Yes, so it goes.  John Rice who was also at St. Paul's has prostate cancer, but not stage 4.  Suddenly cancer seems to be everywhere--my lawyer, John, the person you know, Peer, a friend of Faith.

I went to the drop-in group at Kara.  More women than men usually attend.  Tonight 3 other women had recently become widows because of the death by cancer of their husbands.  The stories would also include mine.

Now it's late and fatigue takes over.

Sorry about your friend.  The choices of what to do at Stage 4 metastatic cancer are few.

All we have is the present.

---

>> Suddenly cancer seems to be everywhere
>>

Yup, Cancer is the second most common cause of death for people over 65.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/older-american-health.htm

Approximately 30–35% of Americans born in 1947 have died as of 2025, with about 65–70% still living.

My colon is 18" shorter than it used to be. ;-)

>> The choices of what to do at Stage 4 metastatic cancer are few.

I was surprised. Survival rates are better than I thought.

>> Five-year relative survival rate for men with distant (metastatic) prostate cancer in the United States is about 28–38%

Karl turned 89 last Sunday. So his chances of living into his nineties are not bad.

Frankly, after living with all these old people for five years, I hope I go by 88 or before. Very few people in their nineties are interesting or interested.

Several of us had a meeting in the garden this afternoon, and I took some photos. I like my garden.

## 2025-07-01

Here is text about one of the things that occurred today:

Larry the nurse stopped me in the hall. My friend Lillemor is distraught, needs help. She is in the ambulance taking her husband Karl to the Hospital. I get a ride in our van. Here is what I wrote there:

At Kaiser ER, in the waiting room listening to a woman wailing while another woman rubs her back. The woman has been bent over and crouching — not standing or kneeling — for half an hour. She does not talk or do anything other than wail.

At last: The first woman is standing. Now the other woman took her ino ER. Now its a room full of people looking at their devices.

Thank goodness I have my computer and can write.

Karl has been diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer that has metastasized. He has a had a blast of radiation to his hip.

He was brought to ER because he almost fell off the toilet being so light-headed. Also very low blood pressure.

They've done x-rays and taken many blood samples.

I've been to see him twice. He is happy to see me and smiles.

Lillemor just came out. Karl is napping. Waiting for test results. I'd like to be there, but only one visitor at a time is allowed in the ER with the patient. By being there, I could help explain things to them later. We shall see.

The results should tell whether he should stay or go hom
How am I doing? Well, I'm inside one of my favorite aphorisms from living on England: "A change is as good as a rest". This is certainly a change from my daily life.

And here I am with perhaps a couple of dozen people all simply getting older while sitting in a chair.

Am I the only one alive here? Is there anybody else actually reflecting on things here? I guess it makes no difference. I am "living in the moment" and that is that counts for me.

OK, brain: what to type out next?

Everybody is wearing rubber soled shoes and jeans or jean-type pants.

Hm. Should I be wearing a mask. I'm about 25 feet from an open door, so maybe I'm OK. There's no coffee here so that is very sad. And I even brought my mug but did not have time to fill it before evening.

---

After writing this, Lillemor and I returned to Heritage and had lunch.

She returned to hospital later in the afternoon. This time Yvonne want with her. Karl returned around 8pm, weak but OK.

## 2025-06-30

I would prefer conversation to discussion. To know about your life increases my understanding of you.

Grief is complex.  Having been through a traumatic divorce in 1981, I know the difference between loss that results from divorce and death.  What I am experiencing now is far worse.

Peer was always fighting to survive cancer.  In the end he could not fight anymore.  We never had a meaningful discussion while he was in the hospital.  We did not share our feelings towards each other.  This still has a devastating effect.  Despair is present and will be.  My will to live is not relevant nor part of my grief process.

Each day presents a challenge.  Creating a stable financial base and a direction uses my energy and adds to anxiety.  This is my life now.

If I were to make an observation about you, I think that I would not drink as much as you do.  Why do you drink?

---

>> To know about your life increases my understanding of you.
>>

My life is public. Start here: https://www.google.com/search?q=%22theo+armour%22

>> Why do you drink?
>>

I drink for the fun of it.

I hear the pain in your message, especially about not having those final meaningful conversations with Peer. That kind of regret is one of the most difficult aspects of grief.

I care about your wellbeing but I do not know how to be of help. I understand you're looking for deeper conversation and connection, but I'm concerned that I can't provide what you need.

## 2025-06-29

Where did you grow up?  Who were your parents and why were they brought up by servants?  Why were you brought up by servants.  All is not clear.

Who were your grandparents?  Please explain.

Peer thought that your family had wealth.  Peer was obsessed with having money.  Of course when he had much, he basically threw it all away.

---

Your questions are interesting. And I'm in an interesting life, so it would take forever to answer them. I do not want to be dismissive, but are such topics the point of our discussions?

Are we on the topic of helping Phyllis find her way out of her despair? Is our discussion about helping Phyllis build up her will to live?

I care about you and want to focus on how you're doing.

## 2025-06-28

Your friend's article addresses the problems of being an aging adult in this country.  I understand what he writes because I am experiencing so much in my own life, especially now that I am alone with grief.

In fact, an article appeared in the Mercury News this week.  I am quoted.

I am merely too sad and tired to respond. My disability is not visible--people don't see depression.

From what Peer told me, your family has not been impoverished.  I am and have been in the past.  I am merely wanting to survive each day without despair.

---

All interesting thoughts.

>> I understand what he writes because I am experiencing so much in my own life

I have little or no disagreement with Pimm's observations.

Nonetheless, they kind of make me smile.

>> The entrances are narrow, the lighting inadequate, the bathrooms elusive. The entire affair feels like an obstacle course—one where the prize is the privilege of sitting uncomfortably in a cramped seat.
>>

Um, Pimm's observations references include "Broadway theaters", "New York City taxi" and "Airports", "country home".

Very much "first world" rich people's issues in my mind.

>> In fact, an article appeared in the Mercury News this week.
>>

I am not a subscriber. All I can see is:

"3 days ago — On Wednesday, she met with Phyllis Wedvick, a Palo Alto resident in her 70s. Wedvick's husband died just two months ago, and she sought out ..."

>> From what Peer told me, your family has not been impoverished.
>>

Depends on what you mean by impoverished.

Both my parents and I were primarily raised by uneducated immigrant servants.

For the first decades of my life no friend of mine was allowed to or invited to set foot or have a meal at my house.

Museums, theater, libraries were never part of my life. etc etc

>> I am merely wanting to survive each day without despair.
>>

I'm with you. I live with numerous people in their late eighties and nineties for whom despair with their predicament is ever present.

## 2025-06-27

>> He became someone whom I did not know.
>>

Meds, disease and pain: alter the brain. Concentrate on what you love about Peer.

>> You seem to be out for dinner during the week.
>>

I think I've been staying at home a lot this week. When I go out, it's to be with young people and have serious, interesting dialogues. When I'm at home, it's to it's to be with my old people.

Here is one thing I did today. My friend Pimm wrote this post:

https://substack.com/home/post/p-166992592
The Most Inconvenient Truth: Growing Old in an America Not Meant for the Aged
_As the U.S. population ages, everyday life—from theaters to taxis to terminals—remains an obstacle course of indifference, revealing a society unprepared to honor the dignity of its elders._

Here is my rebuttal:

## 2025-06-26

Ah, rumble seats.  I first learned about a rumble seat in a Nancy Drew book.  I remember wanting to see a car that had one.

I am learning to have boundaries and to pause before I take action.  Tomorrow, I am making a trip to the storage unit to face my fear about what the unit contains.  Then, perhaps, I will be able to dispose of old furniture, of which only a few items remain.  Then I will see how many boxes of books are available.

As for nerves:  I've always had anxiety as a problem in life.  I also ruminate  more than is helpful.  I am a bit calmer tonight because I realize that I have to stay awake until later than I had.

I am also looking and wondering about purpose.  Perhaps most of my energy went to solving problems for Peer who escaped all of his by dying.

More tomorrow.

---

>> trip to the storage unit
>>

My "Bête noire". I have three storage units: papers, furniture and art.

* The papers are to be scanned and then destroyed unless absolutely valuable.
* The furniture goes to my daughters.
* The paintings go either to museums or daughters.

Over the past 10 years, only tiny amounts of progress have been made. Real life keeps getting in the way.

So I suppose I'm not the one to give good advice. But here goes.

But unless you have a specific new home for an item, dispose of it. Old furniture, books and paintings currently have near zero monetary value.

>> I am also looking and wondering about purpose.
>>

Keep looking. It may be hidden under a rock somewhere, but it's out there.

---

My day was okay, not great, but okay. I did get three walks. I was careful about what I ate. I made pretty good progress on the online blogging system that I'm building to replace the monthly paper newsletter I produce for residents.

A little bit of magic did occur. I asked Claude AI to produce an app that talks and tells you to perform a sitting at your desk exercise every few minutes. Mission accomplished. Quite scary.

---

Death. One of the interesting things about living in an old people's home is that people do die. Quite frequently. but it's okay because they get replaced.

I think that's put too light-hearted for this moment. Two of the people who died I've known over twenty years. One of my things is that I like to think of them as living people. As in "what is remembered lives".

## 2025-06-25

My nerves are still a problem.  I will look for sunshine today.

You are so kind.

The good thing is that you are being conscious of your problem and looking at it and thinking about it.

Starting to be able to look at yourself from the outside and see what happens is a good thing.

Do I hear you saying "Piffle 'Light at the end of the tunnel', I want the full load"

Thank you. It took me a long time to figure out that being outgoing anf generous is more fun than ruminating

---

The neighbor I invited a few days ago came over for lunch today. He owns a 1932 Ford Coupe — the one with a rumble seat. Maybe I will get a ride in it one day. Anyway we had a great dialog. To be continued.

## 2025-06-24

Here I am. Reaching out. Saying hello. Wondering how Phyllis is. Wondering if there was any sunshine today.

---

Yes, I had sunshine today.

Two friends took me to dinner at a wonderful Italian Restaurant in Palo Alto.  I received a book and flowers from two other friends.

A highlight was from the Volcano Theatre Company.  Four of the actors who were rehearsing sang "Happy Birthday" to me through a video.  So cute.

Now i have a message from you.

---

Yippee and Happy Birthday!!!

And may the sun come out from behind the clouds more often

## 2025-06-23

Today I had lunch with two "cousins" and two friends. We were at Perry's Restaurant on Union Street. We started at noon and finished at three. I'm sure we could have talked for hours more, But my legs were getting stiff and it was time to walk. Lots of good chatter about all sorts of things, intermixed with things like hip replacements, battling Lyme disease for 20 years, taking Ozempic, and all sorts of other age-related amusements.

My fellow resident, Carl, it turns out, is suffering from stage 4 prostate cancer and is now at Kaiser Hospital in San Francisco. For some reason, He asked his wife if I could come and visit him. I'm not sure why, but my guess is that since the three of us have  gone out for dinner a number of times, He hopes that we will continue after he is gone, but that is just conjecture.

On a happier note, on my daily walks, I often stop and chat with one of our neighbors. The other day I asked him if he would like to come over to my house for lunch, and he accepted.

I am working on the Heritage Happenings newsletter, which I'm turning from a paper thing into a blog thing. And the first story should go out in the next day or so. I will send you a copy.

## 2025-06-22

Yes.  i am still in shock.

---

I hear you.

I hear you. My eldest daughter, Alix, had a boyfriend who died just about a year ago. It took a long time for her to recover, but she recovered.

---

 I am tired and wish for one night without waking up at 2:30 am.

---

 It took me a long time to figure this out: If I wake up at 5:30 in the morning and can't go back to sleep, it's probably because I drank too much the night before and I'm sobering up.

Could there be some kind of medication that you're coming off of at 2:30?

---

No, it's not medication.  Just fear and worry.

## 2025-06-21

I am awake--I don't sleep well.

When I am at home, I realize how small our home was for both of us.  Peer and I had cute rituals when I made coffee for us in the morning.  We had a slow funny way of being.  Of course we also argued.

What has happened is that the anxiety and fear,  which  used to cause great pain and trouble in my past  are back now.  Very difficult to treat.  Grief is different but produces anxiety also.  I could add PTSD symptoms to the mix or mess.

When I moved to California, I did not adjust well.  Then I began law school at Santa Clara.  Peter suddenly announced that he wanted a divorce.  I will never forget that moment. My reaction was anything but calm.

Tonight I am tired and hope to sleep.

By the way, depression can be disabling.  Many friends that I had made were scared of divorce and not aware of depression and its symptoms.

TIme for sleep.

Phyllis

Living alone again after years of not being alone saddens me.

Hi Phyllis

>> Living alone again after years of not being alone saddens me.
>>

Living alone after so many years of living with someone. I cannot think of anything more debilitating, stressful and depressing.

Your grief makes complete sense. You're mourning not just Peer, but a whole way of life.

## 2025-06-20

I fell apart today and snapped at Peer's brother in a message.  I should count to 10.  My neighbors who had me for dinner and who brought food to me have dropped me as a friend.  Perhaps I alienate people.

Today after going to the DMV this morning to renew my license, I could not do anything else.  I did pick up two prescriptions. Now I will wait to hear Peer's voice in my head.  Not really.  I miss him.

---

Dear Phyllis

Your message almost made me smile. "welcome to the world of people in morning".

People can be helpful but that does not mean that they actually feel or understand what is going on - let alone have any idea how to deal with grief.

I say this because it reminds me of being disabled. People will stop and help disabled people but they rarely feel a need  to talk to disabled people.

I can't say I know myself how to deal with grief, but I readily admit to not knowing.

Anyway, the main thing is that today you got out of the house and talked to some people.

But I'm wondering what you do when you're at home. Do you just sit somewhere and think about Peer?

## 2025-06-19

I spoke to my regular doctor today.  I will need treatment for depression.  It will be important to function.

As much as I enjoy reading your messages, mine are probably too dark.  Right now, I have a sense of being abandoned.  Perhaps it is my fault.

Interesting point. Thinking out loud: Perhaps, am I here because your messages are so dark? Would I be messaging you if your messages were all jolly? Who knows?

We are living in the moment. And messages seem to just happen.

By whom? Peer? It seems to me that he abandoned ship long ago.

My theory: The only person who can abandon you — is you

Yes, depression takes you down deep dark passages, and you can blame yourself for taking yourself, while ruminating, into even deeper darker places.

We have to live with the choices we make, so make good choices.

Did I really say that? If you are depressed, the choices are mostly not good ones. And there's nothing you can do about it.

But if you do get a chance to make a good choice, it's pretty straightforward: ask people for help.

## 2025-06-18

I don't think that I will have the words to explain how I am.  I don't have a solution for myself.  What I will say is that Peer jumped into the transplant process without considering the risks.  He and I would have shared more and lived together more if he had not had the transplant.  This thought does not want to be muted.

I am going to empty the storage unit and give away most of the books to the library for its sale.  I can't afford the storage unit and maybe it is best to let go of items.  I will be 77 next week and as poor as I have always been.  The charity case is probably how friends would describe me.

Yes, my mood is bleak.  This is depression and grief.

>> Yes, my mood is bleak.  This is depression and grief.

I hear you. If I were in your situation, I would be beside myself. A past that turned out sad. A future that is not bright. Not a happy place.

It's not easy to reconcile your position with mine. In recent months, I have been telling people that I have been the most at ease with my life I as I have ever been. (This does not make my life easy, pain free or even simple. It's just a state of mind.)

Anyway, I am reading your message and considering it. I try to not offer advice. I think advice that is given because it has been asked for can be genuine. Unasked for advice that is given freely says more about the advisor than the advisee. So, I just do my best in my messages to you to observe and comment.

And adding comment is critical I think. I ain't no shrink. It's not about "tell me more". I write to you because I find the dialog challenging. And the challenge is to read your words very carefully and the come up with observations that are meaningful and resonates with you.

So here is this evening's pontification, er, words-of-wisdom. ;-)

>> He and I would have shared more and lived together more if he had not had the transplant.  This thought does not want to be muted.
>>

This all sounds like one is able to change the past.

>> Yes, my mood is bleak. This is depression and grief.
>>

This sounds all fixed and final — this sound like a future that cannot be changed.

Would it not be somehow possible to reverse the scenarios??

Past: Peer was great and then he lost it.
Future: Phyllis was lost and found again

I offer these words not as a cure or a fix but only as a possible nudge.

No, I don't think that the problem is not talking to people.  The problem lies in the complexity of the situation with the transplant.  Peer was on a mission from the beginning of the year to find a way to slow down the lymphoma.  He grasped at the transplant idea for many reasons but did not share his thoughts or feelings with me.

For the process to take me by surprise and place me in a fight for his survival for over 5 weeks was not what I expected.  Peer may be free of the threat of his demise but I am on the edge of exhaustion combined with grief.  To lose a partner this way is far worse than you can imagine.  Divorce is not the same even though divorce had terrible consequences for me.

Depression can be severe.  I know what happens because of previous experience with its symptoms.  Today tested my strength.

---

>> Depression can be severe.
>>

I understand this though do not "know" this. I have had periods of depression but I have always recovered.  I would say that a real depression is a depression where you don't know whether you'll ever come out. I've not had anything like that for decades. What I do know is that depression is as debilitating as physical pain.

>> No, I don't think that the problem is not talking to people.
>>

Ah! New insight: I think, from time to time, we are reading the same words in two different ways. You bring up a topic because there is a problem involved. And I look at the same event and try to think of solutions.

You are grieving for your late husband. And that's a real problem. At the same time I think: but that's not the main thing. Maybe the main thing is there's nobody to talk to morning, noon and night. And something could be done about that.There could be a solution

>> To lose a partner this way is far worse than you can imagine.

Holding a child who is beside herself or injured or even merely "misbehaving" can bang on your brain very hard. My uncle was killed in WWII and my grandparents never fully recovered.

Putting it another way, I don't think there is a maximum joy or pain benchmark. We've all been hurt.

Two nice events today:

Lunch with Laura Burgess. She is a Buddhist "personage" at the San Francisco Zen Center and cousin to one of my fellow residents. She writes books about Buddhism for children that are fun. I invited her to speak to my residents, and she was very successful. Also, I organized a tour for our residents to go and visit the Zen Center and she officiated at the tour. Anyway, anytime you have lunch and talk about the meaning of life is a good lunch?

Then this afternoon, a bunch of us, including admins, our CEO, layers, consultants, attended the San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting. The Supervisors voted on our planning permission for our plan to add 23 apartments to the campus. I had two minutes to speak. Looking back on it, I think my words were a bit lightweight. Not to worry, the supervisors voted on a number of different aspects and our side won.

There was a meeting this evening that I wanted to attend, the demo day for a tech incubator. The premises are just a 10-minute walk from here, and I hope to be an advisor, but we got home too late from the meeting for me to be able to do that.

## 2025-06-16

Yes, his brain on medications was not normal by any means.

I am suffering from grief and now what seems to be depression, which I know well.  It is difficult for me to write.

Yes, old age is now a challenge that is present.

---

Today, fingers crossed,  I finally stopped obsessing about writing software and started back on a more normal life. I had two outdoor walks and was more careful about what I ate. I got through a lot of emails, phoned my sister and got a lot of stuff done.

The trick was that coming upstairs after breakfast was not just about starting automatically to keep on with the things I was doing last night, but to stop, think, prepare and reflect upon what I should be doing today, not just jumping in.

We are in the process of adding some new units to the property and we are seeking planning permission and other matters that need clearing up through the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Tomorrow I will be appearing before the Board of Supervisors and giving a two or three minute talk. Today I presented my draft to the CEO and the board of directors and they liked what I wrote. ;-)

>> I am suffering from grief and now what seems to be depression, which I know well.
>>

Yes, without people to talk to, it is so easy fall into difficult moods. Having people to talk to, even strangers, is so helpful. It often starts with finding the motivation to get out of the house, but even that can be hard. Does binge-watching help?

## 2025-06-15

My day was mixed.  Loneliness and rumination led to tears again. The more that I learn about transplants means that I know why Peer should not have tried.  I will never have an answer as to what he was thinking.  From January onwards, Peer did not live in the present.  He lived in his imaginary life with a transplant.  I am sad and angry at the same time.

Now--perhaps sleep.

Happy Father's Day to you.

---

My day was a bit unusual. I text chatted with my daughters. My friend Vish Ratnaswamy joined me for the Father's Day celebration in the dining room. He is a Caltech graduate in his 30s. Smart but conflicted. Among other things, for several years he has been teaching foster kids math and science. He applied for a grant from Caltech and just received $65,000 to fulfill his dream of doing something more long-term and constructive with the kids he is helping. We talked about how to maximize the benefits. How to create long-term solutions that go beyond this sum of money. After lunch, I had to go to the bank, and then after, we stopped at my favorite French cheese store and had three cheeses and a glass of wine.

Then I came home and had a nap.

>> He lived in his imaginary life with a transplant.
>>

I can quite believe this. And I can believe sometimes he would feel that life would be beautiful afterwards, and then sometimes he would feel that "this is the way I will die." and all of this compounded by what happens to a brain that's on serious medications.

>> Loneliness and rumination led to tears again
>>

Old age and solitude do not mix well. Study after study — will tell just you what you already know.

My solution was to find a group of people to live with. I now have 75 friends, and I always will, if any of them died, they get replaced.

## 2025-06-14

At least I had a $400 gift card from AT&T and some cash.  The other MacBook Air essentially died.

Today is full of tears and sadness.  I have Peer's glasses and wallet on his bureau.  He will of course not need them.

Theo, it is too easy to argue with the person you love.  The pettiness I sometimes displayed upsets me when I remember.

So-I do hope that you are having a good day.

---

Hi Phyllis

>> I have Peer's glasses and wallet on his bureau. He will of course not need them.
>>

Ah, yes, the reminders. What to do about all the reminders? The clothes in the closet, the papers in the drawers, a favorite snack hidden in a drawer.

Do you have two bedrooms? Could you take in a roommate? And then you'd have to clean up the whole place, which would take care of much of the reminders.

---

I had a curious day. In the morning, working on AI.

In the afternoon, I went to an assisted living place for the 90th birthday of a person of a friend He has dementia and it's very difficult. Even sillier, his daughter is on the wagon, so there was no booze there. And the food was full of carbs and sugars and things, and not terribly good for me, even though it was too delicious.

---

But the good thing was that this evening I walked about two miles.

## 2025-06-13

My computer is not working.  I am using Peer's ancient MacBook Pro but will purchase a new computer today.  I can still receive email.

Is all well?  I did not know that Green's was still open.  I remember going when it first opened.

---

Hi Phyllis

>> will purchase a new computer today.
>>

Bravo! The people I live with, mostly women who are in their 90s or 100s and who are competent, all are daily computer users.

Most of them say they hate computers. Nonetheless, they can't stop playing solitaire.

For me, a computer is almost like a magic wand. I can make a computer make almost anything happen.

By the way, I also just bought a computer today. A second-hand, renewed iPad for $150 including tax from Amazon. I am not an Apple user, but I am building a website for residents and many residents are Apple users. So I better be able to have a system where I can test the website I'm making and to see if it works on Apple products.

Cheers,

Theo

## 2025-06-11

Hi Phyllis

I hope you had a good chat with the counselor in Minnesota and gained a better understanding of what Peer was prepared for and what he did and did not share with you.

And the past is what it is, immutable apart from our acceptance and understanding of it.

My daughter Cynthia returned from France last night. She took part in her aunt's 80th birthday and is staying a couple of nights, cat-sitting in our cousin's place in Oakland.

She came over for dinner tonight and we met at Green's restaurant in Fort Mason, the vegetarian restaurant. We had a lovely meal and even better conversation.

One issue of discussion was particularly interesting. I'm finding that there are new ways of writing software with AI. I'm using the new, but I don't yet know how to explain what I'm doing. It's so strange or wrong or whacky that I can't find the words to explain this strange abstraction that is occurring. It's like using buildings to create blueprints. Or poems to create math equations.  

Anyway, I'm obsessed over all this stuff. And I think it's kind of wonderful that I can be 78 and obsessed about anything.

Cheers,

Theo

Hello, Theo,

I just returned from The Stanford Theatre where I watched two silent films starring Reginald Denny, listened to a conversation between David Packard and Denny's granddaughter, and a short documentary.  All week the theatre will have silent films in the evening.  A welcome distraction.

Tomorrow when I talk to my counselor in Minnesota at the National Marrow Donor Program, I will explain how odd it seems that Peer is gone.  Today, I did not cry but did sense detachment.  Something was off.

Recovery will be difficult.  Now it seems that I will have to purchase a new Mac as mine is faltering at 7 years old.

I am tired and it is 1:37am.  Time for sleep, I hope.

Phyllis

>> Reginald Denny
>>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Denny_(actor)

Extensive career

I've seen him. "Batman" and "Around the world in 80 days."

But he doesn't ring a bell in my brain. But from the Wikipedia entry, it looks like he was an interesting person. After all, he was involved with remote control airplane drones. What is the war thing of the day.

Anyway, the main thing with me is that I don't really go to movies anymore.

Why should I be sitting silently next to somebody I would rather be talking to?

>> I will explain how odd it seems that Peer is gone.
>>

He is not gone. You brain is full of living thoughts about him. Deep down your brain is telling you that Peer wants a PB&J or that the temperature is wrong or whatever he expressed he needed. Just because he is dead, does not mean your "muscle memory" understands this.

For all intents and purposes, my mother is still alive in my brain, but actually she died in a car accident in 1983.

And that's what I'm finding with all the people that have died since I moved into my wrinkly home. As much as possible, treat people as if they're still living. It can't hurt you. It's not likely to bother them.

## 2025-06-09

>> Now, research demonstrates that grief is not linear.
>>

I very much agree and understand.

What I find at least somewhat plausible is that she identified different aspects that do seem to occur with many people in no particular order or strength. And yes there are certainly more than five. And fatigue seems very relevant.

The interesting thing is trying to identify the aspects that one is going through oneself and how they manifest and repeat.

A lot of the aspects involve ruminating - going over the same thoughts over and over again. And a good practice is trying to identify what is being repeated and trying to break out of that pattern. But I am out of my depth here. And I'm sure you with the help of Kara are way deeper into matters like these.

And no matter what, the grief still keeps on coming on.

Peer: very, very few people ever seem to ask: why? It's much easier just to roll with the program. Do what the good "whoever" suggests.

>> I am giving myself a break today.
>>

Yay!

## 2025-06-08

>>  Having dinner at the Dempsey's house gave me a happy break from worry 
>>

Yup! Being with people you can talk to makes such a difference. With Peer gone, there's no one to talk to. Therefore anguish sets in.

I've learned to live by myself - and to enjoy it. But it took me forever to learn how to be my own best friend. 

Of course it helps having 75 people living in my house along with 70 or so staff. And everybody is on a first name basis. And if any goes, they get replaced. ;-)

>> I am also mentally tired from all.
>>

I hear you. Living the same scenes over and over again is toatally draining and wearisome.

Have you figured out what stage you are in?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief

>> What do you do when you program?
>>

;-)

It's like asking a chef, "what do you cook?"

I should have something to click on soon.

>> It's not easy or clear,
>>

I hear you. Some days are better. Some days are worse.

It's no way the same thing, but I also had a better and worse day, and I'm not sure which it was.

There's a part of the software I'm working on that is quite complex. I just tonight realized that there is a much simpler way of handling things. The realization happened after working on the complicated way for weeks. And a part of this code has been lurking in my software, perhaps, for years.

Now, should I be angry with myself for having spent so many months and hours doing the wrong thing? Or should I be totally pleased with myself for finding the right thing?

Well, I won't try the new easy way until tomorrow. Maybe it it will have complications too. Anyway, the questions remains: how did I allow my brain to play such a trick on me?

## 2025-06-07

I am happy to hear that you got out of the house and had a busy day.

>> I have to find myself again.
>>

A most positive and forward-thinking thought! Let that search begin.

## 2025-06-06

You are being very quiet. I would like to be able to say "I hope you're doing okay", but I'm sure that's not actually the way things are for you today.

I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to say or do. In the past, I've been talking about my day and things that I'm doing and thinking about. But that doesn't seem to be fair or equal if the things I'm doing are any fun, which in my life they are.

This is so hard.

For you, of course, for me on how to be helpful or useful.

I do hope that you have been getting out, getting some fresh air, and have been to Avenidas. and I hope that you have some plans for the weekend.

And did you know that today was National Donut Day? And that our dining room had a zillion donuts. And me trying to avoid carbs and sugars and lose weight and things like that consumed a scrumptious diet-busting artisan donut covered in a maple syrup glaze.

## 2025-06-05

So today I did a lot of programming. Though I did do some admin in the morning.

The nice thing was that I overdrew my bank account. I haven't done this for years, and it wasn't much. So the easiest thing to do was to go to the bank, take some money out from a credit card and pay it into the checking account.

Well, one of my quite elderly fellow residents here has had a stroke and now he gets around by an electric wheelchair. I invited him to come along with me on the walk down to the bank. To my surprise, he agreed. and he had a lovely time getting out of the house.

## 2025-06-04

I'm thinking that grieving must be very, very hard. It's been decades since I've lost anybody close. My wife and I split up around 25 years ago, but we've been on reasonably good terms with each other ever since.

So there you are, stuck with all these thoughts, and there's nothing, zero, nada you can do about the circumstances that happened that is causing those thoughts.

What I am very familiar with, however, is ruminating over the same thoughts over and over again.

I spent much of my teens and twenties ruminating and being depressed and being lonely and not knowing what to do about it.

I'm trying to think of something that would be helpful to say, but all I can say is I've been there.

Actually, I guess I could also add that I'm no longer there. But even then, I do understand that while you're down, you never know how you're not going to be down.

And even more bizarre since I live with a lot of old people. Guess what? Death happens quite frequently. On average, 10% of us die every year and there are 75 people living here. Of course, it's not anybody like a spouse, but nonetheless, people that you know and are very fond of.

So I think one way I process it is that in my brain, they're still alive. I could eat something and say, "Oh, that's what Eleanor likes." or walk past a restaurant that is Bernie's favorite. Something like: what is remembered lives.

I think the main thing is having things to do, places to go, and most important, people to talk to.

One of my favorite things to do when I'm lonely is to go to a bar and sit at the bar. Unlike most bars around the world, in an American bar, if you're sitting, you can talk to the person next to you. It took me a long time to figure it out and to overcome my inability to talk to strangers.

And, BTW, bartenders are like free analysts.

But now you could drop me in almost any American city, and by the end of the evening, I would have a nice new friend.

I'm just saying, because it took a hell of a long time to get there. ;-)

## 2025-06-03

There are 75 residents here. Probably at least 30 of them have hearing loss issues. Remember, the average age is over 90.

Today we had a woman come in and conduct a hearing loss support group meeting. As far as I'm concerned, she was a total loss, a wipeout, a fail. She actually knew almost nothing about the clinical condition of hearing or the technology tools available. All she wanted was people to talk about their hearing loss issues.

I am conflicted. We could have had dozens of people here, but I'm glad they didn't come. They would have learned nothing.But that is speaking with the the bias of a being a comparatively younger "techie".

On the other hand, these people have allowed themselves to go deaf without seeking help. What she was offering was an opportunity to discuss the personal issues of hearing loss. Not my cup of tea, but what certainly a number of my fellow residents should be considering.

How do these people allow themselves to be difficult to communicate with when there are readily available tools to help them?

---

How about a San Francisco visit next Monday or Tuesday? Or possibly Thursday?

## 2025-05-27

Were you able to get to Avenidas today? I hope so.

What do you like to do when you're there?

---

I'm always amazed at the brain. Thoughts just keep coming in, day in and day out, year in and year out. You can't stop them. They are incessant. And you have little or no control over them.

Well, I have learned that if a bad thought comes into your brain, you can tell it to go away. Not always, of course.

The result is that, for me anyway, every day is different. Even if I stick to a schedule, every day is not quite the same as the day before.

Anyway, today was rather nice for me. I caught up on email and sent out several emails of introduction, one of which has already worked. Connecting people always feels satisfying.

I also completed, or fixed, or kind of finalized the program that I'm working on. and installed it on a bunch of websites and they seem to be working.

and I've just finished doing my 5,000 steps which even included two little short trips outdoors. and I didn't eat too much, so the weight should be good when I check in the morning.

I think I check or record or keep track of a bunch of little things in my life. And so it's always possible to find some happiness somewhere in what I did during the day.

And maybe that's part of a little sort of life rules thing that I like to think about: Look for something beautiful.

I hope your day went well.

## 2025-05-18

>> Well--are you ever lonely?
>>

Yes.

And it's the loneliness in the middle of a crowd, loneliness.

I live with 75 others and have three meals a day with them. And almost as many staff to chat with as I walk up and down the halls, getting my steps in.  All our friends, some closer than others.

Nonetheless, there's nobody here I can talk to about linear algebra, JavaScript, artificial intelligence, and other STEM topics.

There are very few that could talk about economics, political science, historiography, medicine and in any depth.

Of course I do have these online, but there's nothing better than a good face-to-face discussion that can go on for hours, floating from topic to topic, with somebody who knows what they're talking about.

So it goes

## 2025-05-17
