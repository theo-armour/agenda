Hello Torrey and Quentin

I learned tonight that John Walker ~ founder of Autodesk and genius  ~ was killed in a fall down his staircase on 2 February at age 75. He had been still totally and aggressively doing crazy smart things. We were in regular contact.

I am processing what's next and my involvement with his legacy.

But I started today by thinking about the future of Endiatx and how I can help.

My first interest in spreading the word about Endiatx is to Jason Carman. I think you guys would be a great fit for his Saturday Startups.

Here are some of his links

I started a draft of an email to Jason but it's not ready to send yet. See below. Perhaps you can help? Please review. I would like to use similar text in any other introductions I write. In particular I would like more and better works to describe your technical accomplishments - after these words "I learned that the PillBot is entirely manufactured in the premises" in the sixth paragraph. Feel free to make any edits you like.

Even more fun: do you have a photo that shows a great overview of thw workshop with all its gear and people?

More tomorrow,

Theo

Hi Jason.

I hope this message finds you as energetic as ever.

On Tuesday, I was giving away one of my AR devices (Brilliant's Monocle) on their Discord channel. My offer was responded to within minutes up by Quentin Caron of Endiatx. Within just over an hour he drove up from Hayward and we met at The Interval to carry out the transfer. This young Frenchman (your age) blew me away with his technical knowledge - EE & ME - and even more with his enthusiasm and energy. He's a real go-getter.

I know this because we really double-clicked into Endiatx where he is Chief Engineer.

"Endiatx makes robot pills for telemedicine. Our first product, PillBot, is a virtual endoscope or “moving eyeball in the stomach”. It's a pill camera you swallow that lets you access the world's best GI doctors without leaving home."

Later that evening he was back at the workspace in Hayward. He zoomed me into the latest test run of the PillBot. Torrey Smith, the CEO, led me through the testing process. To my delight, Torrey is just as energetic and engaged as Quentin.

There issues with the test run. So I got to talk with a bunch of team members. I learned that the PillBot is entirely manufactured in the premises. 3D printing, flexible circuits, camera assemblies - all designed and built in-house.

Jason, I think you should meet these guys. They should be a great fit for your Saturday Startups. I'll be pleased to make the introduction.
