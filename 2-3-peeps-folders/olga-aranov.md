Hi Olga

Thank you for your message full of cool links. I heart good links.

Yes. It was a good, engaging dinner. I particularly enjoyed learning about the concept of musicianship. It’s obvious when you think about it but, heh heh, I have never heard it before.

Here are my links:

### Swimming Camps

There are a number of organizations offering swimming camps in the US. Could you get one interested in sponsoring a camp at Cahuita?? Below are some of the ones that I have found.
I see that Skill Swimming offers camps in Peru. The one for this year is already fully booked. So why not Costa Rica as well?

### Investors

Looking for potential investors in a swimming camp program in Costa Rica. Two approaches:
• Contacts offered by the swimming camps - such as the the ones listed above
• Wealthy people in the Costa Rican community in the Bay area

Ferguson reminds me of a calypso musician I remember from the 60s George Symonette - Calypso and Goombay Rhythms

* Simplicity
* Two story LR

Questions
* Why two stairs?
* If two stairs, upstairs bedroom to be kept locked as any other external door
* Only way to large upstairs terrace is through the bedroom ~ why not reverse the stair
* Upstairs bathroom not over downstairs - where go plumbing?
* Upstairs may need more handrails and balusters
* structure seems a bit light in some areas

Want
* Allée: Perspective view from front entrance through other glass door to object in distance
* Something for children
* Site plan with drive, parking spaces & turnaround, septic tank location and significant trees
