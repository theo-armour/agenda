# 2025-07-14 Questions for Vada

Seeking understanding for five roles:

Me, Heritage Happenings editor, Board of Directors, Advocate, residents & family

Also, right now: Lillemor's advocate

What do I need to know to perform well in these roles?

How can I learn what the boundaries are?

Some aspects that come to mind include:

1. Care for MediCal residents or "Grace and Favor residents" by HotM
2. Regulations and controls: Government, Type A contracts, Type C contracts
3. Supplementary caregivers: PCP, medical concierge, Admin help

Questions

1. How to deal with residents who do not have a viable and active Power of Attorney person?
2. How to handle situations where residents require more care than Heritage on the Marina can provide?

This is Day One on my learning curve. I understand that we are talking about generalities. I also understand that it will take a good amount of time to build up my understanding
