Hi Mary

Next Friday I will be 75. I will be having dinner with my daughter Cynthia.

It would be a special treat for Cynthia and me to dine in the Heritage dining room. It might also bring pleasure to our residents to be witnesses (socially-distanced) to a endemic-aware family dining experience.

My daughter Cynthia is vaccinated and boosted and recovered from the virus ibn early 2021
We are seated at the table for two at the remote end of the dining room near the fireplace
Social distancing and masking guidelines are strictly followed
Windows at that end are open
We are both tested prior to entering the dining room
