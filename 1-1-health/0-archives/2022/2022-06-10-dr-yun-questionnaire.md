Medical History / Personal Pillars of wellness

Dr Yun

in 2020, at the request of a NP student who was learning by interviweing, I wrote out my ideas of my medical history in response to a set of questions she asked.

I enjoyed the process. It felt useful to me. I also believed it helped the student dive more deeply and more quickly into my overall health status.

I am wondering: Does Pine Park has any health investigation tools that may be similar at hand or planned? I think it wil be fun to document and create metrics for mu own "Pillars of Wellness" agenda. My question is: where do I start?

Please see the attached document for the 2020 paper:
