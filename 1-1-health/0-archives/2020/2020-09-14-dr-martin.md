* Very happy here. Good decision
* Nonetheless there are adaptations to be made ~ see below

Recent Urinalysis

* Bacteria: new or same old?
* White Blood cell count: is this an issue?
* Can observe light-colored "things" in urine  ~ 1 or 2mm string-like


Neorpathy

* Dimishing or just getting used to it?
* Exacerabated by alcoloh consumption maybe
* Prediabetic?

Skin

* Continue to have rashes and scales oo=in hair ~ slather with Triamcinolone Acetonide every day
