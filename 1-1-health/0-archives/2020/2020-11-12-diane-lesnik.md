I was interviewed by a nursing student

## Intro

I will be asking you a number of questions related to your present and past health history as I prepare to enter practice.  These are questions that I will be asking all of my patients.  I will not be diagnosing, assessing, or making recommendations.  This is an exercise providing an opportunity to organize my efforts for future history-taking in an outpatient medical setting.  The information gathered will only be used as anonymous information as part of my training and learning as NP student.  No personal identifier information will be shared.

There is nothing you really need to prepare unless you want to take the time to organize some of the following.  I’ll ask you the specifics to direct the interview.
