I am a partial paraplegic with an amputated left hand - resulting from a fall off a roof in 1969. In November, 2022 I fell and broke my left femur. Ever since my ability to walk has been increasingly hampered. I now use a walker for longer walks. Without a walker or cane, I can hobble with baby steps.

I am seeking ways of improving walking with a cane. The issue is that I put much pressure on my right arm while walking with a cane. This is causing pain in my right shoulder and right wrist as I walk. When I am not walking there is no pain. Also, my right hand tends to fall asleep in bed at night.

I am making good efforts to improve my walking: 4,000+ steps a day, 6 flights of stairs and regular PT. Nonetheless further improvements will take a very long time. In the meantime, I seek ways of preserving and ameliorating the condition of my remaining upper extremity.

While walking with a cane - but not forgetting all the other uses of my right arm, what might be some good ways to strengthen and protect my right arm?
