Urine
My urine is currently very smelly and getting cloudy. What do you think about a urine test?

Fatigue
I seem to be wanting to take two naps a day. One more nap thanNo  usual. Infection issue? Anemia? Who knows?

Pelvic cavity pain
Slight chronic pain in the pelvic cavity to right of reproductive system. Onset was while pushing too hard to poop (a week ago?). Pain is not sharp, but dull and constant. A bit more intense upon pressure.

Statins
OK, let's try statins. Very low dose.
