Hello Gabriel

Thank you for your email of September 21.2023.

I find your writing remarkably comprehensive, detailed and easy to read. Thank you!

Personally, I have no great need to change my current Medicare coverage. Nonetheless, I plan to schedule an on line with Mary Thomas to review my options.

Here is my request: My former wife (and friend) Isabelle is French and lives in Paris. She is 66. She would like to maintain the possibility of Medicare coverage in case she decides to return to the US to be near one of the children. She is a US citizen but never paid into Social Security. Her benefits come from being my former wife.

Would kindly be able to recommend someone who could advise her on her options?

Happy Holidays!

Theo
