I'm sorry about the password login issues. It's my lack of experience. I've not worked much with passwords. The great majority of what I do is public domain so protection is irrelevant. Where I do need protection it's a complex dual factor authorization thing which I let be handled by GitHub or Microsoft or whoever.

Most of the files in this repository could be public, but a few files talk about money and so I'm thinking a light protection is probably a good thing.

Thank you for your feedback. Fingers crossed: the fixes I put in work for you.

## Preface 2024-01-01

Start with the "Links of Interest" below.

My apologies for not having a menu system in place yet. I am working on it.

For now you can click on the links below to navigate to the various white papers, but you will have to use the back button to come back here to get to the next paper or you can use the "Simplicity Read Me" link at the top of each page.


## Preface 2023-12-30

"Simplicity" is the name of the project to simplify my life. The project includes the agenda for "Finish the Design" of my life and other stuff.

At the same time, "simplicity" is one of a number of folders in a GitHub repository that I use to organize my life and maintain personal agendas.

The "ai" tags indicate text that was generated by GitHub Copilot that I find to be "creative" as I write my own text. Example:

\<ai> sample AIsample text AI sample text AI sample text\</ai>

## Concept

If I simply wanted to simplify my life in a simply way, I could just throw or give away a lot of stuff and stop doing a lot of things.

But I don't want to do that. I want to simplify my life in a way that is simply sustainable, caring and beautiful.

Question: It seems that my brain is saying this needs a lot of thinking about and much writing. Is this my brain prevaricating? \<ai>Or is it my brain being smart?\</ai>

Are these the rantings of an elderly man with nothing better to do. Or will they be useful ro someone, somewhere, sometime? Hello historian of 500 years from now. I'm looking at you. Are you reading this?
