Hello Team William Stout Architectural Books

I have about 20 bookshelf feet of books on architecture, construction, design, and art. Most of these are from the 1970s to 2000 and relate to my studies at the Architectural Association and becoming registered with the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.

It is now time for these books to find a new home. I would like to donate them to your good cause.

If you are interested, please let me know. Either I can meet someone at my storage unit at 99 South Van Ness Avenue, or I can arrange to bring them to your location.
