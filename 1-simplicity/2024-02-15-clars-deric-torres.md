## First message

Dear Deric

Claudia Kraehe at Step By Step Downsizing recommended I reach out to you regarding a collection of furniture, china, and silverware.

For your reference, I've attached "Hobart Appraisal Update 2024." I'd greatly appreciate your expertise in finding new homes for all the items listed.

These items are currently located in a storage unit at Public Storage (99 South Van Ness, San Francisco). My immediate priority is to find buyers for the furniture to create space for unpacking the remaining items.

Would you be interested in reviewing the appraisal and potentially discussing auction options? I'm open to your suggestions and feedback.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Theo


## Deric's Response

Dear Theo,

Thank you for considering Clars Auction Gallery.  Unfortunately, due to the extremely weak market we would be forced to decline the opportunity to bring your collection to market.  The conclusion is two fold, one being the current market and the potential prices realized, and second is our very limited storage capacity.  I would suggest Michaans Auctions in Alameda, as they would likely be receptive to taking the entire collection.  I must stress however, the market is extremely weak, almost nonexistent.

Respectfully,

Deric Torres

Senior Vice President


## My thanks + question

Hi Deric

Thank you for your speedy reply and your insights regarding my "collection". I concur with your observation that the market for "old brown stuff" is non-existent. It makes me think: this must be a wonderful time for collectors of such stuff - and frustrating because they don't have the ready access to collectable pieces they used to have. ;-)

Thank you also for your Michaan's recommendation. I am pursuing it.

One small further question, before I sign off: Looking at your recent action prices, I see that china and silverware may be having issues similar to furniture. So, do you see any bright spots anywhere? What type of things are you currently looking for?

Theo
