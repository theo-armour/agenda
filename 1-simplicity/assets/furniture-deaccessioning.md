# Furniture Deaccessioning

## Preface

The term "Deaccessioning" is used humorously here.  It is a term used in museums to describe the process of removing items from the collection.  In this case, the items are being removed from the collection of the Armour family.


### The project

A dozen or so furniture items have been in a Public Storage unit at at 99 South Van Ness in San Francisco for over twenty years. They are in need of restoration and cleaning.  The goal is to:

* Clean and restore each item for the following
* Photograph the items so that the family has a good permanent record of them. And so that I may be able to use these as reference for describing their provenance and my interest in each work in a future multi-media autobiography.
* Sell or donate the items either at auction or through a dealer or online.


### The process

The "expediter" or furniture preparer is likely to have access to a van and some workshop space suitable for

* Cleaning and minor touchups
* Short term storage
* Sufficient space for photographing the items
* Packing the furniture for shipping or delivery as required

Timing

* Flexible
* Perhaps 2 or 3 items at a time
* Charges, payment and insurance on a per item pay-as-you-go basis


## The items

The following items are numbered and priced according to a Hobart Associates replacement value appraisal from 1992.  The items are listed in the order they appear in the appraisal.

I may be missing one or two items.  I will update this list as I find them.
