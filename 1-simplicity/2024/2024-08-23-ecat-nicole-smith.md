## Two Pieces of Furniture

## 2024-09-01

Dear Alix, Cynthia & Eloise and Nicole and Claudia

Two Saturdays ago the Federal console desk and Queen Anne high chest were taken out of storage. And the way this happened was beyond my imagination. Here is the story:

Nicole Smith is a furniture restorer based in San Rafael. She was introduced to us by Claudia. Claudia had sent photos of the pieces to Nicole. Nicole had said she might like the pieces for herself.

Nicole came to see them. She loved them. She took them.

Nicole did not just "take" the pieces. She physically picked up the pieces of furniture by herself and lifted them out from the unit and placed them on the dolly and then hoisted them from the dolly to her husband's truck. People who like to hug furniture are my kind of people.

The dream as always is to find nice new homes for good old pieces. I'm not sure Nicole knows yet how the pieces will be used. But I have no worries: She will do her best to take good care of them and either keep them or find nice new homes.

Thank you, Nicole, for taking the pieces. And thank you, Claudia, for making the connection.

As and when I find out more about the provenance of the pieces, I will let you know the details. My feeling is that the desk was from the estate of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall. The high chest was from the estate of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall. The chest was definitely from the estate of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Armour but may have also belonged to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armour.

Cheers,

Theo

Hi all,
Firstly I want to thank you Theo for the beautiful pieces.

I have finished the repairs and restoration of the Federal console table and  have included some before, during, and after pictures of the repairs. Here is a brief description of what I did to it.  I glued the broken leg back on, then filled and touched up the damaged area. I also glued back on the broken foot and added new wood to the foot to reinforce the area. The castors were frozen and didn’t roll so I cleaned and oiled them. I added wooden plugs to each foot so the screws that hold the brass feet on could be properly tightened. I added a wooden patch to replace the missing veneer on the oval leg detail, then colored and finished to to disappear. I repaired the loose edge banding on the top, ad added another wooden patch to replace a missing piece.

Finally I cleaned, touched up and restored the finish and color to the entire piece. My father really likes this piece so hopefully he can find a place for it in their house. I’ve just started repairing the loose veneers on the secretary, but I will probably have to put it aside for a bit to work on customers projects for a while. I’ll send pictures of the secretary when it’s finished.

Thanks again,

Nicole
