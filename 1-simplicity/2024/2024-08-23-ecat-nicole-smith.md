Dear Alix, Cynthia & Eloise and Nicole and Claudia

Last Saturday the Federal console table and Queen Anne high chest were taken out of storage. And the way this happened was beyond my imagination.

Nicole Smith is a furniture restorer based in San Rafael. She was introduced by Claudia. Claudia had sent photos. Nicole had said shee might like the pieces for herself. She came to see them. She loved them. She took them.

She did not just take them, She physically picked up the pieces of furniture by herself from the unit to the dolly and from dolly to her husband's truck.
