## Two Pieces of Furniture

Dear Alix, Cynthia & Eloise and Nicole and Claudia

Two Saturdays ago the Federal console desk and Queen Anne high chest were taken out of storage. And the way this happened was beyond my imagination. Here is the story:

Nicole Smith is a furniture restorer based in San Rafael. She was introduced to us by Claudia. Claudia had sent photos of the pieces to Nicole. Nicole had said she might like the pieces for herself.

Nicole came to see them. She loved them. She took them.

Nicole did not just "take" the pieces. She physically picked up the pieces of furniture by herself and lifted them out from the unit and placed them on the dolly and then hoisted them from the dolly to her husband's truck. People who like to hug furniture are my kind of people.

The dream as always is to find nice new homes for good old pieces. I'm not sure Nicole knows yet how the pieces will be used. But I have no worries: She will do her best to take good care of them and either keep them or find nice new homes.

Thank you, Nicole, for taking the pieces. And thank you, Claudia, for making the connection.

As and when I find out more about the provenance of the pieces, I will let you know the details. My feeling is that the desk was from the estate of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall. The high chest was from the estate of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall. The chest was definitely from the estate of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Armour but may have also belonged to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Armour.

Cheers,

Theo
