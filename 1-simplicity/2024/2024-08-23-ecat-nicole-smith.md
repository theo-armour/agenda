Dear Alix, Cynthia & Eloise and Nicole and Claudia

Two Saturdays ago the Federal console table and Queen Anne high chest were taken out of storage. And the way this happened was beyond my imagination. Here is the story.

Nicole Smith is a furniture restorer based in San Rafael. She was introduced to us by Claudia. Claudia had sent photos of the pieces to Nicole. Nicole had said see might like the pieces for herself.

She came to see them. She loved them. She took them.

Nicole did not just "take" the pieces. She physically picked up the pieces of furniture by herself and listed them out from the unit and placed them on the dolly and then heaved them from dolly to her husband's truck.

The dream as always is to find nice new homes for good old pieces. I'm not sure Nicole knows how the pieces will be used. But I'm sure she will do her best to take good care of them.
