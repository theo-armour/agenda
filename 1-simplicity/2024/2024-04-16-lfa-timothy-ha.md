Items in Storage

Hello Timothy

I am following up on Claudia Kraehe's email to you on April 5, 2024.

We are organizing a shipment of some the works of art that Lawrence is safeguarding for us to be sent to two of my daughters.

So that we are all on the same page and can more easily identify the works in question, can you please send a copy of the manifest of the works now in storage with you.

Once we have the manifest, we will be able to identify the works that we would like to have shipped and can request a quote from Lawrence Fine Arts.

Th√©o
