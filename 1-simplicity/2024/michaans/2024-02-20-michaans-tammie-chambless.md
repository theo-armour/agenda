to me, Claudia, ecat

Hello,

Our appraiser Jill Fenichell has taken a look at your items. And they do meet our minimum to move forward and open a contract.

Although, those estimates in the appraisal are Insurance we will offer then for FMV (fair market value).

I have attached our contract for your review.

Any questions please let me know.

Best Regards,
