Hi Sarah,

Thank you for getting in touch. Sorry for my slow reply.

Yes, I have received the quote that you and Claudia put together. Thank you for this.

My first issue is that the quote for shipping the goods is most likely higher than the value of the goods themselves. The items have a ton of sentimental values, but not so much monetary value.

The second aspect is that I and my daughter can do much to simplify the process.

For example, I can get the two chairs to wherever Lawrence wants them for packing. My daughter Alix can organize a pickup up of the items from the arrival pint in Holland.

Also, time is not an issue. Therefore the items could go by sea rather than air.

Would any of these updates - or any you can think of - be of help in brining the price down to a level that aligns with the monetary value of the goods?
