# [Simplicity Read Me]( https://theo-armour.github.io/agenda/#1-simplicity/README.md ) /  [2023-12-30 Cash Flow Design]( https://theo-armour.github.io/agenda/#1-simplicity/2023-12-30-cash-flow-design.md )


## Preface 2024-01-15

This paper is still quite higgledy-piggledy. I have no good example or template - and no previous experience to follow. Maybe one day...


## Preface 2024-01-04

Having now written the "2024-01-02-preface" document, I have a better I idea about what to write about here. So expect more detail and background here in the next few days.


## Concept

Finishing the design will require resources and time. I have the time. I need to figure out the resources - the people and the money.

### Project costs

There will be:

* Consultation
* Photography
* Appraisals
* Freight ~ local and long distance
* And storage until it is sold, donated or given away

I have zero idea how much thesewill cost.

### Income

* Furniture ~ very little
* China, glass and silver ~ very little
* Jewelry ~ ??
* Art ~ good tax deductions

### Shipping

* Shipping to ACE ~ ??


## General Principles

### Smooth cash flow is wanted

* I can deal with money dripping out of my portfolio
* I don't deals so well with chunks of money dropping out of my portfolio
* Try and keep with taking less than 3% out of portfolio

### My long term investment strategy

On average investments in the stock market have returned 7% to 10% per year. See links belo

Over the past thirty years, I have allocatd my income as follows:

* Spend up to 3% of my portfolio per year paying taxes
* Spend up to 3% of my portfolio per year paying expenses
* Allow the rest to grow to cover inflation

Generally, investment guidance for the elderly who wish to grow their portfolio is to take out 4% per year. This what the trust fund pay out.

### Get it done

If you can't fix it yourself, throw some money at it

The major cost will be the digitization of the collection. I have no idea how much it will cost.

I must set a limit on how much I spend. How about the cost of buying a new car is the maximum I should spend?

## Income

* Currently drawing $9K month from portfolio
* Income $1K social security ~ $1,500 - $450 Medicare deducted
* No more Websight Design income (was $4K per year)
* 2023 special: $25K California state tax refund

The $9K month has been the same for a decade or more. It's time to increase it.


## 2023 What I spent

* $108,000 from Pershing to me
* $28,500 from Pershing to Manatt ~ not including payments I made using my monthly money


### Expenses

* $4,500+ month goes to Heritage for rent + donations ~ not including guest & wine charges
* Roughly $1.3K month goes to college loans << coming back soon

Rough fixed costs

* $300 Lawrence Storage
* 1400 Public Storage
* $177 Phone
* $337 Blue Shield + Silverscript
* $100 Marina Cleaners for laundry
* $300 Online stuff & charities

### College Loans

Yup, I'm still paying them off

* College Loans 2023-12-04: Total Current Balance: $56,781.84
* No other loans
* Note: Loan interest is all capitalized
* The interest has now been paid off, all current payments pack back the principal

Perhaps I should have refinanced the loans. But I didn't. Anyway, refinancing now would not be a good idea.


## Goals

* Empty the storage units
* Pay off college loans
* Give money to ACE

## Strategies

* Take money from sale of furniture etc to pay off college loans
* Take money that was going to storage to pay off college loans
* Pay off college loans
* Then give the money to ACE


## Gifts & Taxes Reminder

* $17,000 max in 2023 / 12 months = 1416.67 / month

Once I pay off the loans, I want to resume giving money to ACE. I would to do  $17K per year.

## To Do

* Zelle sucks.How to set up ACH?
* Kayakomat shares to ACE
* DAF
