## Preface 2024-01-04

Having now written the "2024-01-02-preface" document, I have a better I dead about what to write about here. So expect more detail and background here in the next few days.


## Notes

* I can deal with money dripping out of my portfolio
* I don't deals so well with chunks of money dropping out of my portfolio
* Try and keep with taking less than 3% out of portfolio

## My long term investment strategy

On average investments in the stock market have returned 7% to 10% per year

* Spend up to 3% of my portfolio per year paying taxes
* Spend up to 3% of my portfolio per year paying expenses
* Allow the rest to grow to cover inflation

Generally, investment guidance for the elderly who wish to grow their portfolio is to talke out 4% per year.



## Income

* Currently drawing $9K month from portfolio
* Income $1K social security ~ $1,500 - $450 Medicare deducted
* No more DWA income (was $4K per year)
* 2023 special: $25K California state tax refund

The $9K month has been the same for a decade or more. It's time to increase it.

## 2023 What I spent

* $108,000 from pershing to me
* $28,500 from Pershing to Manatt ~ not including payments I made using my monthly money


## College Loans

Yup, I'm still paying them off

* College Loans 2023-12-04: Total Current Balance: $56,781.84
* No other loans
* Note: Loan interest is all capitalized
* The interest has now been paid off, all current payments pack back the principal

Perhaps I should have refinanced the loans. But I didn't. Anyway, refinancing now would not be a good idea.


## Expenses

* $4,200+ month goes to Heritage for rent + donations ~ not including guest & wine charges
* Roughly $1.3K month goes to college loans << coming back soon

Rough fixed costs

* $300 Lawrence Storage
* 1400 Public Storage
* $177 Phone
* $337 Blue Shield + Silverscript
* $100 Marina Cleaners
* $300 Online stuff & charities


## Goals

* Empty the storage units
* Pay off college loans
* Give money to ACE

## Strategies

* Take money from sale of furniture etc to pay off college loans
* Take money that was going to storage to pay off college loans
* Pay off college loans
* Then give the money to ACE


## Gifts Reminder

* $17,000 max in 2023 / 12 months = 1416.67 / month


## Questions

* How to set up ACH?
