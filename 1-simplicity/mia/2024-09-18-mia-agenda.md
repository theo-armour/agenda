## Helpers

Hi Mia

I have used helpers in the past. Three times out of five I have been "burned" by them. The most was by a Craigslist helper that for whom I requested and received two recommendations.

There must be a better way. Here are two organizations I know about and a third that popped up on a search:

* https://www.sfvillage.org/about/
* https://nextvillagesf.org/how-we-help/
* https://www.gogograndparent.com/

Would you like to see if they could help us?
