## Three White Papers

Finishing the Design ~ the need for a clean break ~ the pivot ~ the "from" and the "To" The Final Design ~ the nuts and bolts of the who, what, when, where and why it can be done Designing the Cash Flow ~ how to pay for it all ~ how to benefit from it all

The gist is that I plan to make a major re-jig of things so that I take a hand-on role in the management of my legacy.
