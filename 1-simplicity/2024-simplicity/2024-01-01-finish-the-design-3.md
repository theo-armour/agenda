## Preface 2024-01-02

Adding text from 2024-01-02-preface.md

* "Finish the Design #1" is personal to me
* "Finish the Design #2" is about the benefits to others
* "Finish the Design #3" is about metaphysical benefits


## Preface 2024-01-0

I am happy with the writing in "Finish The Design #1" & "#2", but I think there's more.

I keep thinking I am missing some significant aspects of the project.

For example: What is this "finish" thing and what is this "design" thing?


## Finish

### Generally

* All the thing you have - have a "digital twin" - a digital representation
* The digital twin is stored in the cloud and is accessible from anywhere
* The place in the cloud is of archival quality

### Things

* All the things you have are identified and catalogued
* All the things you have are photographed and described
* All the things you have have been curated and commented on by you

### Meta

* All the things you have - have their five W's
* The map is bigger than the territory
* Obeys a schema ~ follows a template


## Design

In the old days the design was the coffin and the tombstone - which fit in wil al the other in the grave yard.

Now the design is the digital twin - which fits in with all the other digital twins in the cloud.

What does that look like and how does it work?

What happens to people who are happy to be forgotten?
