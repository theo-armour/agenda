# Photographer Request for Proposal


## Concept

You image-ination is the only limit. Your ideas are welcome.

To photograph collection of paintings and furniture for the purpose of cataloging, appraisal, sale, archiving and the creation of an interactive 3D timeline artwork.

The collection may not be of great value, but it is quite precious to me. I would like to have a record of it for my own purposes and to share with others.

## Mission

To help me build an online archive of the collection.

## Vision
