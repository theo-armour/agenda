Hello! Very proud of you, this is great, and very inspiring! WAY more people need to do this.

Surprised to see this in a PDF!?

### Questions to daughters

• Did you learn anything new in reading this?
yes the goldfish story sounds vaguely familiar but can't remember exactly, and many other things

<i>I've talked about Tulip from time to time. It must have something to do with sensing a feeling of agency. Childhood may be highly reactive. Being the "decider" may be rare. It certainly was in my childhood</i>

• Does any of this resonate with aspects of your creativity?
too much!

• What do you think of the idea of "designing" your life?
I just wrote about it again yesterday. We are too similar!

• What do you think of the idea of "designing" your legacy?
Honestly brilliant, I tell many friends what you're doing, they all admire you for it. very clear-sighted. Makes me think about mine too.

<i>Interestingly, some people here at Heritage desire no legacy. They are happy to disappear after their death</i>

• What do you think of the idea of "designing" your cash flow?
It's a must, and might as well start early. ideally, investing in passive income so you can retire stress free!

<i>What I find interesting is that I have just enough money. I don't have a lot of money to give away. But I do have enough money to live on. Therefore I can give my time away. Having the time to help, to care, to build for others about as good as it gets.</i>

• Will it actually be possible for me to pivot my life?
Yes, if you simplify and FOCUS :-)

I think this list is quite strict but in the right direction, in my opinion, highlighted are the things I would try to do.

### Do not do list ~ (The Mission?)

• No more saying "yes, can do"
• No more offering to help or show
• Do not become involved in other people's projects
• Do not start new projects
• Do not offer to go out even for a cup of coffee
no, but maybe think about 1xcoffee a week quota + 1xcoffee a week with people coming to see you.

• No trips of any length,
also maybe apply a quota per month?

• Drop out of all groups, projects, committees, etc.,
first evaluate all of them simply and see which ones bring YOU the most satisfaction.

• Stop developing software
but you cleaning up your life now may allow you to develop beautiful things later because your mind will be FREE.

May I share this or parts of this with Stefanie?

<i>Everything I write is public domain, So anything goes</i>

I feel like you need to read a Marie Kondo comic book. May I send one to you for xmas PLEASE?

<i>Purchased in 20218 and shared with Éloïse</i>

<i>You might be surprised at how many Kondo-like aspects there are in my little monk's chamber

* Everything is visible
* Everything has a place
* There are not too many things
* There are too many USB cables

There are design choices most everywhere. The objects on my bathroom basin demonstrate at least six "tricks"

This was a lovely and thought provoking read

I especially enjoyed the lists of projects by era. I know that we've heard of a lot of these but seeing it all in writing is helpful for me (who doesn't have an elephant memory like you or Eloïse lol). So that, for me, is new.

<i>These memories will be added to a timeline or two that I have worked on previously.</i>

<i>In my dreams, I make drawings of all of these</i>

Something familiar? Ha. The endless drawings. And projects (for me, writing) begun and often left unfinished.

<i>One can be finished with something at is unfinished. Especially when the effort is part of a project and that effort is no longer needed</i>


I was very curious of how the AI's input was potentially incorporated throughout.

<i>When AI is making a big suggestion I will annotate the text with \<ai> tags. If it's just completing a sentence with a few words I will not.</i>


Is this possible/realistic? I think only if you accept some balance. Being too demanding or dogmatic (it must be simple, or it must be complicated) lends itself to, well, complications. Extremes are difficult. So, yes with the Added aspect of balance - of realizing that in different phases of life we may overcorrect and so it doesn't have to be all or nothing.

\<ai>Yuval Noah Harari has a great line in his book "Sapiens" about how humans are the only species that can believe in two contradictory things at the same time. I think that's what you are saying here.\</ai>

<i>Both overcorrecting - and letting go - can be of interest in themselves. ;-) </i>

I like Alix's suggestion of Marie Kondo - mostly because she brings in so much JOY to the simplification process. A good reminder that throughout the process it's lovely to be thankful for the beauty, meaning, or joy that things we live with have brought us.

<i>Good design, Marie Kondo and the like all resonate wih me. I have a paper to write in my mind. My bathroom basin - all by itself - incorporates *eleven* elements of Kondo, Dieter Rams, and the Bauhaus in order to help the basion on the objects on it to air-dry in a speedy way. I have a lot to say and joy to share about things like that.</i>

What do I think of designing your life? I think intentionality is important. Life is not as long as we think it is - or rather, (less dark) it is in many different sections, and each section moves swiftly.

<i>Intentionality: is of the essence. I generally try parse this into a concept that has vision, mission, and values ~ perhaps all as ways as solving a problem ~ in a sustainable, beautiful way.</i>
