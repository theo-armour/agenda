Hi Rick

Thank you for your speedy and detailed reply.

I am knocked out by your website! I cannot imagine of a better solution for helping source new homes for our beautiful old things that require help.

Plus: an experienced and skilled and knowledgeable person who desires to teach others is a treasure. Producing YouTube videos with actual students at hand could make for engaging workshops. I hope I can be of assistance in making this project a reality. And just to be clear: If I can help a craftsman prosper in the process, I am all in.

Thinking out loud: Would you like to have a look at *all* the furniture and other things that need repairs in storage? The storage is in a Public Storage units at 99 South Van Ness in San Francisco. We could meet there and have a chat about what you think is possible.

Cheers,

Theo
