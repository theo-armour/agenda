Hello William Stout Architectural Books

I treasure the memories of your wonderful premises.

I have about 20 bookshelf feet of books on architecture, architectural rendering, history of architecture, construction, design, and art. Most of these are from the 1970s to 2000 and relate to my studies at the Architectural Association in London, becoming registered with the Royal Institute of British Architects in London and restoring old buildings in London.

It is now time for these books to find a new home. I would like to donate them to your worthy cause.

If you are interested, please let me know. Either I can meet someone at my storage unit at 99 South Van Ness Avenue, or I can arrange to bring my treasures to your location.

Theo
