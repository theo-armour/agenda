## 3D Scanning

Rather than taking photos of all my stuff, we will 3D scan the stuff.

Good photography takes

* good lighting
* good background
* good photographer

Results: time-consuming, costly and prone to failure

Scanners

* Scanners are fairly cheap
* background is less of an issue
* May need lighting uses latest technology
* will more useful in 3D timeline
