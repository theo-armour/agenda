# 2024-01-17 Rico  has a look See


Hello all

This morning Rico and I went to have a look see at the furniture that is "being deaccessioned from the museum".  I have attached his quote for restoring te work. His visit cost $375, but it was worth every penny.

He looked at nine pieces and gave me a quote for cleaning or repairing each.  I have attached his quote.

To be blunt: He is not in the business of fulfilling Theo's magic dreams (though he himself is wonderful)

The idea that the pieces could get to space where they could be photographed as objects of beauty is a dream.  I don't think it's going to happen.

IMHO, there are three pieces we should keep and six to be sold.

Three pieces to keep:

* Two chairs Alix
* Chest to C or E
* Semainier to C or E

We need to figure the shipping methods and costs to get them to you.

Given: we should look for a buyer for the 12 chairs.

With the six pieces, the next step is to get an appraisal with the guideline that these are to be sold.

Cynthia already has table, bench, chaires and more

Given that it's only six pieces to be soled, the first thing is to obtain an appraisal.

I think we should get an appraisal and sell them.
