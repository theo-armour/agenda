Hi Tammie


Thank you for your message and confirmation.

>> So will all the items shown in the attachment below be coming in?

No, my three daughters will be taking some of the items.

My daughters are on their way to San Francisco as I write this. They will be deciding what items of furniture they wish to keep. I will be in touch with you next week with an updated list what items of furniture they have decided to sell.

See also "staging" below.

>> Also, it will sell for FMV not the prices that are on there now, which is Insurance.

I understand this very well. "Old brown furniture" is not in vogue at the moment, but between Michaan's and Live Auctioneers, I am confident that you provide as good a service as possible in the current market.

Staging
All the items to be sold are in Public Storage units in San Francisco. I want to dispose of the major furniture items first. This will open up space for unpacking and taking good photos of the china, silverware and the other smaller items.

Currently the furniture is quite tightly packed in the storage units. Taking good photos of the furniture is difficult, but the items are visible and may be easily inspected.
