The \<ai> sample text \</ai> tags indicate that the text was written by an AI


## Introduction

Having previously written three white papers on three aspects of this life design thing. I now come back to looking at the whole picture. Here are some typical questions that I ask when I am designing my life.

* What problem is this solving?
* What is the concept?
* What is the mission, vision, values?
* What is the who, what, where, when, why, how?
* What are the SMART goals?
\<ai>
* What are the KPIs ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator
* What is the strategy?
* What is the plan?
* What is the execution?
* What is the feedback loop?
\</ai>

### Even deeper

* Are all 24 virtues dealt with?
* Are the needs for beauty and security dealt with?
* Are the needs for love and esteem dealt with?


## Overview: the three white papers

### 1. Finishing the Design

The why

The need for a clean break ~ the pivot ~ the "from" and the "To"

### 2. The Final Design

The nuts and bolts of the who, what, when, where

### 3. Design the Cash Flow

How to pay for it all

How to benefit from it all
