Hi Carlos

I look forward to have a conversation with you. I am available on the on Monday after 2:00 pm.

If you will not be available on Monday, please let me know when you are available after having completed looking after Liz ans Marty.

I would like to discuss your availability to help me with the tasks like the following:

Short term: Rearranging my closet shelves and selecting clothes for donation

Longer term: Going with me to my storage unit at 99 South Van Ness to help process the donation and archiving many books, photos & slides, family documents, and other items.

Whenever: Finding new homes for technology items that I no longer need.

I do want to disrupt any of your other activities such as you help with Marty and Liz. I also want to minimize your travel time by having you help me when you are already in the area.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

Theo
