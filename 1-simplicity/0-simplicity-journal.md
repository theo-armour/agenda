## 2023-??

* out: Theramin thing


## Medical Bills, invoices and similar records

* In the very highly unlikely event that they are needed, medical papers just go into a yearly file box. Sometime after the year is over, the contents are destroyed


## Message

Do you know someone who is a pro at helping with downsizing? Is there somebody out there who likes to organize the process of donating and selling 'stuff'?

Participate in two related projects

## Evereverland

Mission: Enable individuals and families, using digital and other media, to knit together the threads of their lives so as to preserve memories and artifacts for posterity. What is remembered, lives.


## Theo Armour:

* a [thanatological]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatology ) [intervention]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_intervention )

Mission: Package a complex history of many parts and generations into a durable work of art


### Your efforts

These efforts might use your skills on a variety of fronts including: admin, art direction, curating, writing, managing, organizing and primarily: being curious and imaginative.

The goal is that you work on the parts you like and help source other people to do the bits they might like.


### Status

The current effort started in 2019, well apart then was restarted in 2021. Currently I and three others are involved and I pay all the bills.

Progress is very slow. We don't know what we are doing yet, so it's taking time.


### Program

The timeline for a project of this complexity needs to be flexible and long term.

Trajectories, duties and pay scales can always be open to discussion and planning.

Initial efforts need discussion, agreement and documentation prior to implementation


### Spinoffs

I think I am not alone in seeking help in managing my life at Heritage on the Marina. There are a number of residents who might use some small number of hours of admin services from time to time at a good price. Thankfully, few such demands would be as higgledy-piggledy as mine.

### Next Steps

We agree to meet once or twice a week for an hour or two, until such time as we agree a plan or work or decide to go our ways

I agree to deposit a non-refundable retainer of $500 in your bank account. During the course of our discussions we agree to payment terms per hour.
