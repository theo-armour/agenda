## Michaan's : Furniture Consignment Inquiry - Referral from Claudia Kraehe

Dear Tammie,

Claudia Kraehe at Step By Step Downsizing recommended I reach out to you regarding a collection of furniture, china, and silverware.

For your reference, I've attached the "Hobart Appraisal Update 2024." I'd greatly appreciate your expertise in finding new homes for all the items.

These items are currently located in a storage unit at Public Storage (99 South Van Ness, San Francisco). My immediate priority is to find buyers for the furniture to create space for unpacking the remaining items.

Would you be interested in reviewing the appraisal and potentially discussing consignment options? I'm open to your suggestions and feedback.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

### Hello Tammie

Unless otherwise noted, all of the items could use a new home. The items are currently in a storage units in att Public Storage at 99 South Van Ness, San Francisco.
