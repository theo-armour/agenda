Sorry for the lack of posts.

Here's the thing: I seem to be in a block

* Usual post-partum getting the newsletter out
* Recluse currently with a demanding social life
* Mid-winter blahs
* Programming: straight forward, highly effective, easy, what I like doing. Finding new homes for old things: OMG, complicated, time-consuming [1]
* Imagine living in Barbie land. You can do anything. Even Ken. So what do you do in Barbie land besides getting distracted by yet another project of beauty? [2]
* We live in a world where so many bad things are happening. Nonetheless, some people have to live in the happy place. Otherwise, we'd all be in the bad place. And that would be bad.

[1] I could write for hours here. The essential thing: educating myself to design the processes that will make it easy to find new homes for old things.
[2] Sitting here at my desk with zero pain, sufficient funds, more than enough connectivity, and plenty of time: the only limit is my imagination. It's like living in a virtual Barbie land.

More tomorrow.
