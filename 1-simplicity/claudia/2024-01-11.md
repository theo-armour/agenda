# 2024-01-11 Meetup with Rico

Hi Claudia,

Meetup with Rico
The meetup almost occurred. We were within about fifty feet from each other. Eloise and I in the storage and going out to the parking to check and Rico was in the main office doing the same. Unfortunately, he had lost his phone the day before and so we were unable to connect. We will try again on Wednesday 17 January. This time I will go to his shop and we wil drive over together.

In any case, Eloise and I had a good look at the items and were pleased with out visit.

Your Comments
Thank you for sharing. All nice, fresh thoughts. Keep it coming. We will work out a way of commenting. All my stuff is on a resource used by programmers GitHub.

In the meantime copying to a Word doc is fine.

Piet Hein invented the superellipse, and he also invented the super egg. I have a 1" high superegg on my desk. The "Grook" was new to me. Love it, Anti-proverbs. Here is one of mine: sometimes you just have to dive in and then you find your sea legs.

Things Theo can make
My parents threw all my stuff away. I can, however, recreate them. And hope to do so one day
