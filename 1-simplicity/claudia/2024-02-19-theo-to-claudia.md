Hi Claudia

## Intent

I think you know this, but I want to reiterate it so it is clear.

My intent in dealing with all my possessions is "to find good new homes for nice old things". Of course, this may not always be possible, but it is the good guiding principle. I am willing to pay for fixing and transport, and I am willing to give things away. I am also willing to sell things.

I am not willing to throw things away, unless they are truly worthless.

My anathema is to have something I have treasured and lived with for years end up in a landfill. I am willing to put in any extra effort to avoid this.

## Shipping

My daughters are in the process of deciding what items of furniture they would like to keep. Once they have decided, I am willing to ship things to them.

This means that I will need to find a shipper.

* Alix will want her things to go to Amsterdam
* Eloise will want her things to go to Montana
* Cynthia may be able to drive her car to pick up things and take them to Yosemite

Can you help with finding a shipper or shippers for these destinations?

## Photography

As part of the notion that everything I have owned is precious or worthy of being written about at some future time, the process of documenting is coming to the fore.

I need to rekindling the request for a proposal for a photographer. I started a paper a while ago, but I need to find it and finish it.

Once done and agreed, I will send to Douglas Sandberg - the recommended photographer.

## 3D Scanning

I have also been thinking about and looking into 3D scanners as an alternative or adjunct to photography.

Recently, the price of 3D scanners has dropped down into the low hundreds of dollars. I am planning to acquire one and to scan furniture and 3D objects.

Depending on the results of the scans, the may reduce the needs for traditional photography.

## Alix and Cynthia visit

Alix and Cynthia will be in San Francisco between March 8 to 11. While they are here, I hope we will all bde able to get together and discuss the future of "The Final Design" or whatever.
