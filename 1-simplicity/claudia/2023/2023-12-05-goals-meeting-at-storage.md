* Unit #2 1418: *97192218# ~  7x10 ~ to right of parking


## Tasks

* Listen to Claudia
* Hear what she has to say
* Respond to her questions
* Identify all the items in unit #2 ~ 20 or so?
* Identify all the items in unit #1 that are the furniture at the front of the unit ~ 10 or so?


## Planning

* Discuss the logistics of disbursing the items
* Begin to identify an "expeditor" to help with the logistics
* Identify familiarity with EA, "Being a good ancestor". the Long Now Foundation, and keeping the historian of the future happy


## The Major Objective for the items in Unit #2

* For over forty years my objective has been to preserve and protect the family history so as to be able to pass it on to the future
* Forty years ago (1981 to 1984), this was a major shift in my thoughts and actions
* Up until I was about 35, I had been focused on crafting, creating and commissioning new objects to add my life
* The deaths of my great aunt, grandmother and mother in the early 1980s altered this focus: preserving and protecting became the focus.
* In recent weeks I have been thinking about the future of the family history
* Frankly, the crafting, creating and commissioning times were a lot more fun and engaging
* I have decided that I prefer to leave to my three daughters to opportunity to craft, create and commission their own lives rather an obligation to preserve and protect the family history
* Of course, the legacy must be preserved but via a different path: photographs and written records. The physical objects themselves are enabled to become opportunities for others to collect, enjoy and preserve


## Other Benefits

* Help reduce the cost of storage down to zero
* Setting up a repeatable process for the future
