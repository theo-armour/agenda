# 2023-12-17 Claudia Consulting Proposal

Hi Claudia

Thank you for your good and extensive correspondence.

Taryn Edwards
Taryn sounds like and excellent recommendation for the "documentalaist" part of the effort. I will contact her and see if she is interested in working with us.

Cow Hollow Woodworks
As you can see by my message to Rico Dell'Osso: I am very interested in working with him on the project. Here is what I wrote in my journal

Visited Rico at Cow Hollow Woodworks: Dream come true ~ skinny fifties/sixties working in his shop ~ family from Lucca ~ family had farm in Napa ~ born Oakland ~ had shop for 30 years ~ Liked the photos ~ likes the project ~ we will touch base 2 January

Working with you
Until something changes, I need somebody to talk to about the project and you have been wonderful.

What I need is simply somebody who reads my emails closely and responds to them in a helpful and encouraging manner - which is precisely what you have been doing.

May I propose a compensation of $250 per month for your time and effort?

If you are interested, I can let you know in more detail how I would like to work with you.
