# 2023-12-23 Claudia Contract

Hi Claudia

A signed version of your contract is attached.

I look forward to an engaging dialogue with you.

Payments
Please do dip into the retainer as needed. Please track of the hours and let you know when we are getting close the $250 level. Let's always keep at least that amount in the kitty.

Taryn Edwards
I will contact her next week to see if she is interested in working with me.

I will let her know that it may take some weeks before we can really get started. The current priority is to get going with disposing of the furniture, china, art etc

White Papers
I am working on three documents that I am sharing with my daughters. Rather opaque descriptions:

Finishing the Design ~ the need for a clean break ~ the pivot ~ the "from" and the "To"
The Final Design ~ the nuts and bolts of the who, what, when, where and why it can be done
Designing the Cash Flow ~ how to pay for it all ~ how to benefit from it all

I will share them with you in the coming week. I look forward to your comments.
