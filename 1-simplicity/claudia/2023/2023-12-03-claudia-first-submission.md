Here is a link to the PDF of an appraisal prepared by Hobart Associates in 1992 of many of the items now in the two storage units:

I look forward to meeting you (and your colleague?) on Tuesday morning. There is parking inside the building. I plan to be at Unit 1488 at 11. I will text you when I arrive. Text me when you arrive and I will let you in.

My daughters Alix, Cynthia and Eloise are copied on this email.


Cheers,

Theo
