Dear Deric

Claudia Kraehe at Step By Step Downsizing recommended I reach out to you regarding a collection of furniture, china, and silverware.

For your reference, I've attached "Hobart Appraisal Update 2024." I'd greatly appreciate your expertise in finding new homes for all the items listed.

These items are currently located in a storage unit at Public Storage (99 South Van Ness, San Francisco). My immediate priority is to find buyers for the furniture to create space for unpacking the remaining items.

Would you be interested in reviewing the appraisal and potentially discussing auction options? I'm open to your suggestions and feedback.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Theo
