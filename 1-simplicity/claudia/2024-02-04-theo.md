Hi Claudia

Than you for all your very thoughtful and considered messages. I really appreciate them.

Auction houses: Michaan's, Clar's and Sotheby's (also Christie's ).

Note all the apostrophes in the names of the auction houses. ;-)

> Maybe send pictures to all three and have one come our for a site visit and the other two estimate online?

Good idea, but I might start with just Michaan's and Clar's. I have a feeling that Sotheby's and Christie's are out of the league of any the items of furniture.

I plan to send the latest version of the Hobart Appraisal 2024 to Michaan's and Clar's. I will ask them to come and have a look at the furniture and give me an idea of current values. I will also indicate that I am interested in selling all the other items in the appraisal at a future date. BTW there are many more objets d'art in the original appraisal that I have not yet copied over to the latest version.

I will draft a message to Tammie Chambless at Michaan's and Deric Torres at Clar's and send it to you for your comments.
