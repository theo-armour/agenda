The items in your email are stunningly beautiful!

A quick question for now:  I know some furniture (desks, cabinets, tables) sometimes have secret drawers. Perhaps you know the answer regarding what is listed here, but if not, would Rico know?

People didn't just put valuables in these drawers, but documents, letters.)

First, I am circling back to something NOT related to your current endeavors for the
furniture, but want to make note while I remember:
Regarding your CAD designs – I found the attached link to a list of libraries that house
books and other items related to the history of technology.

What stood out to me was the Smithsonian’ Dibner Library.
Perhaps you were thinking of posting in your legacy project, but would you consider
additional places?

Re: George Armour and the Great Chicago Fire – Wikipedia amazing story that
confirms a documentary on the Chicago Fire that I recently watched that described
makeshift financial transactions sites were established s quickly following the fire.
George Armour was a very, very, smart fellow!
Quick thought: If some furniture, china donated – would the Chicago Presbyterian
Church be interested? I read that George Armour donated the church tower, though I
suppose the tower burned down in the Chicago Fire…?

Some important repetition re auction houses and clearing out your storage unit.
There are unfortunately many beautiful pieces of furniture that decades ago were worth
much more than they are today. I am using worth: in the sense of current market value
(what is selling) as opposed to historical and sentimental value. Auction houses are
good for offering information about various items and for giving you an idea as to
current market value. They also offer a platform for selling your furniture pieces to
people who would want them, either for themselves or to resell. In either case, the
furniture would end up with someone who see the beauty and value in what they
purchase. Another positive about auction houses is that you and the auction house
decide on the initial price. If an item does not sell at that price, you can always retrieve
it. Yet another advantage is that auction houses is that if they were interested in your
furniture, they would take other items as well.
The disadvantage to an auction house is that people often have to pay to have the
furniture transported. Even if the auction house is willing to take the cost of
transportation out of the proceeds, people can end up being disappointed.

You were very smart to set a goal timewise for rehoming the furniture and clearing out
one storage unit. I do think it worthwhile to spend some time considering options in
addition to an auction house, perhaps spending the most time on one very special
piece, and then if you haven’t come upon another alternative, go the auction house
route?

More later.

A couple thoughts:

Although Michaan’s has been the auction place I have had the most experience with, when I have given talks, people have often mentioned they sold at Clar’s.

Clar’s does have a higher minimum auction value, but you shouldn’t have any problem with that aspect.  Perhaps consider sending pictures to both Michaan’s and Clars?

Also, you had listed Sotheby’s as a possibility.  I assume you saw the following?

Maybe send pictures to all three and have one come our for a site visit and the other two estimate online?

Getting an idea as to potential value is a sensible next step.

Depending on what you learn, there may be additional options for your furniture to have a suitable next life.  In looking at the photos, I already have one idea.  More to come.

I have been talking with a gentleman about a matter unrelated to you. He does have experience with various auction houses, so I asked him which one would he consider to be best.  His email reply is below.

"Sotheby’s is top notch .
I prefer michaans to Clar’s.

All attract a good crowd on line , but I suspect Clars gets the most attention but doesn’t have a great reputation."

Just an FYI.
