# Simplicity Reference

Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as
two or three, and keep your accounts on your thumb nailâ€¦

Thoreau on simplicity from _Walden_

This topic is about managing my affairs and possessions

The objective is to be a stellar example of an "evereverland" a domain in EverEverLand.

## Simplicity

As Thoreau said: "Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumb nail."

In this instance, "Simplicity" applies to me and me dealing with my life, its activities, duties and possessions

It prepares stuff to go to evereverland, or to family or wherever.
