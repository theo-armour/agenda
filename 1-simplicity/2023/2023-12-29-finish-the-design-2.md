## Preface 2024-01-02

Adding text from 2024-01-02-preface.md

* "Finish the Design #1" is personal to me
* "Finish the Design #2" is about the benefits to others
* "Finish the Design #3" is about metaphysical benefits

## Preface 2023-12-29

I often say that I designed my life.

I like to think that my multi-dimensional autobiographical timeline will be a work of art.

I like to think that I live the interesting life of an interesting person..

Very nice, but what is the end game?

Do I stop and retire?

Do I buy a fishing pole and go fishing?

No that's not me.

I must finish the design. Fingers crossed in a friendly, sustainable and beautiful way.

This requires than an endgame be designed.


## What is this finishing the design thing

* It's about tieing together loose ends
* If "what is remembered lives" then put things where they can be remembered
* If it can't be remembered then try recreating it - make it live again
* Making things available to the historian of the future
* "Being a good ancestor"


## The interesting life of an interesting person: me

<AI> * My life, like any other, is a tapestry of triumphs and trials, successes and setbacks. Each thread, no matter how seemingly insignificant, contributes to the overall pattern and beauty of the tapestry.

* I live an interesting life
* I seldom talk about it, because I don't seem to have a need to do so - to bragg or to impress is not my style
* And I like and care about learning other people's lives more than talking about my own
* I have been to many places and done many things
* I have assisted in at least three game-changing earthly transformations
  * The industrialization of China in the 1980s
  * The digitalization of engineering in the 1990s
  * The expansion the Internet from 2D to 3D
  Of course, I was not alone in these transformations
* Nonetheless, in each of these, I was a part of cohorts numbering in the just few dozens of members
* And, I have been involved in dozens of failures too - also interesting. ;-)
* Interestingly, I come from a long line with numerous rich and famous interesting people
* I like to think that I am an interesting person too without having to be rich or famous
* My hope is that this project helps other ordinary people to design interesting lives of their own


## The lives of ordinary people are just as worth keeping around as the lives of the rich and famous

<AI> Every life has a story worth telling. Ordinary people often lead extraordinary lives, filled with quiet acts of courage, resilience, and love that may not make headlines but are nonetheless deeply impactful

* The right to be remembered: a universal human right?
* If you are an ordinary person then you may learn much from the lives of other ordinary people, perhaps more than from the lives of the rich and famous
* Of course, you have a right to be forgotten too, if you wish


## Build the useful and beautiful repository of my life

<AI> This digital repository is not just a collection of memories, but a living testament to my journey, a reflection of my identity, and a legacy for future generations.

* Capture, copy and create everything digitally
* Find new homes for all the physical stuff
* Curate, categorize, tag, locate and date everything
* Add recollections, notes, insights, instructions and stories to everything
* Link everything together and to timelines, maps, calendars, databases, etc.
* Use AI to find patterns, insights, etc.
* Use AI create new things
* Back up everything to the cloud - Internet Archive, GitHub, MS365, etc.
* Make the data publicly available - where appropriate


<hr>


There may well be time between when the final design is complete and when I die.

I don't really want to think to much about what happens after it is all up and available and I am still alive and kicking.

Anyway, I have a few ideas.

## Create sustainable and beautiful life stories

* Recreations - me at five in Paris ~ Grandfather in Haiti in 1922
* Bring the music, fashion, art, food, etc. of the past into the recreations
* Create XR experiences that are like the Kaiber music videos I have prompted
* Offer insights, backstories and instructions to the recreations in chat boxes or asides
* Compare and contrast the with alternative histories that were occurring at the same time
