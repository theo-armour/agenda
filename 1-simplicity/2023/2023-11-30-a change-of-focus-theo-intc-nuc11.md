_Became "Finish the design"_

I have been a designer all my life. Perhaps this was my first design:

Around 1950 or 1951 in Paris, I was given a goldfish. What I remember is that I placed  the fish was in a small spherical bowl on my bedside table a bit closer to me than the lamp. I named the goldfish was "Tulip". I was 3 or 4 years old. I made something happen for someone that was not me. In some way I was trying to give pleasure. I never forget it.

In the appendix below I list some of the things I designed and made as a child and young adult.

By my late twenties I understand that I was a designer. This is not to say that I was a good designer. I was not. I was a designer in the sense that I was always designing something - usually a simple but "designed" solution to serve a current need.

In 1978 my father died and left me $75,000. And that opened a realm of possibilities that my four thousand pound annual salary as an architect working for a tenant worker cooperative did not.

I began to "grok" the idea of "designing" my life. I began to see that I could design my life in the same way that I design a building or a piece of furniture. I could step outside my body and imagine my life as a design problem. I could imagine a solution and then work to make it happen.

From this came the idea thaI should take a sabbatical every ten years. This led to my glorious failure to Swim the English Channel in 1980.

And that in turn led me to another important insight: I am not an Englishman. So with mu new wife Isabelle went off to line in Hong Kong with two one-way tickets. For the first yea with shared a tiny apartment with my friend Robbie and I continued commissioning furniture

Then in 1982, my wonderful Auntie B died and left me a good amount of money. I now had enough money to by an apartment. Which we did an I immediately started to redesign and rebuild it. I also started to commission furniture and other things. But the other aspect of Auntie's legacy were numerous pieces of furniture, paintings, jewelry and more each  of which was already well know to me as I visited her every year in her home in Princeton, New Jersey.

***

For fifty years I have been protecting and preserving the legacy inherited. The mission was to keep it say and make all this beauty available to future generations.

Do you know what happens when all the paintings on the walls are ones you cannot sell? You stop commissioning new paintings?

The whole legacy thing becomes a burden. To make things even worse, I have planning, in essence to pass this burden on to my children.

Time for a clean break.

I want my children to that the freedom tp design their own lives. I want them to be free to make their own mistakes. I want them to be free to make their own successes. Especially without carrying the burden of my legacy.
