# [Simplicity Read Me]( https://theo-armour.github.io/agenda/#1-simplicity/README.md ) / [2023-12-23 Final Design]( https://theo-armour.github.io/agenda/#1-simplicity/2023-12-23-final-design.md )

## Preface 2023-12-23

Yet another draft. Not even as complete as "Finish the Design". But it is a start and needs the most work in January.


## Series

This is the second of three papers that I am writing to help me think through the next phase of my life. The three papers are:

* **Finishing the Design** ~ the need for a clean break ~ the pivot ~ the "from" and the "To"
* **The Final Design** ~ the nuts and bolts of the who, what, when, where and why it can be done
* **Designing the Cash Flow** ~ how to pay for it all ~ how to benefit from it all


## Concept / Vision

This paper describes a plan to deal with the legacy furniture and other items that are in storage in San Francisco. The goal is to move them out of storage and into the hands of people who will appreciate them. The plan is to have all the furniture and lamps out of storage by the end of the first quarter of 2024.

Further aspects of the plan might be to take all the documents and images and use the to create a multi-media timeline of the extended Armour family.

After that, an idea might be to utilize the methodologies to further the the EverEverLand project.



## Guidelines

* Plan, start or build a single project at a time
  * Furniture", "China", "Silver" are separate projects
* Only start a new project one the previous project is well under way and nearing completion
* The current project is completing the will and trust funding
* The upcoming project is about dealing with the legacy furniture

BTW

* Will my sister Allison want any of this?



## The Plan

* List all the types of things (prohects) that need to be dealt with
* Identify the actions that need to be taken; the desired results
* Prioritize them
* Identify the people to help

See "Furniture and Lamps" below for an example of the process.
