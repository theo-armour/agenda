# Box Triage

* First prepared for Trina

Admin

* Payments via PayPal or Zelle or other digital service
* Documentation via Google Docs
* Time sheet maintained
* Registered user with GitHub

First Pass: Look See

* Look at everything
* Look at everything again
* Identify self-organizing self-evident structures utilized by the subject to organize their own efforts
* Manipulate the stuff unto piles you can deal with
* Consider the totality
* Organize the artifacts
* By date then by original order if discernable then by type

Second Pass: "Triage"

* Something like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage
* Build on online collaborative apps such as Google Docs
* Create the "digital twin" ~ a document that reflects the artifacts closely
* Closely mirror the organization of the artifacts gathered in the first pass
* Name everything according to naming conventions ~ see below
* Highlight the unique, the special, the noticeable
* Identify the corroborative evidence ~ material that substantiates known positions
* Deal withe the chaff: the stuff that is so sufficiently documented that new evidence is redundent

Third Pass: Document / Judge

* All it may take to be sublime forever is but just a single moment!
* Can you identify such transcendental moments in the pile of papers you are charged to triage? The probability is unlikely.
* Can you identify the normal moments of a normal trajectory? Even in the most special times people still eat breakfast and go peepee and whatever and document it.
* Can you identify points of inflection ~ trajectories that indicate a situation that marks the start of significant change?
* Can you at the same time give credence to the general understanding of a particular time and epoch by the material at hand?


Naming conventions

* URL/Internet link friendly
* all lowercase - always
* words-separated-by-hyphens
* Dates always year-month-day ~ so as to sort nicely
* example 2022-07-01
* General Format: date-author/owner-title-recipient-if relevant.extension
* to be delineated in more detail
