Hi Tania

This is to introduce:

Jennifer Biederback ~ https://www.sothebys.com/en/about/team/jennifer-biederbeck
Carol Elkins ~ https://www.sothebys.com/en/about/team/carol-elkins
Alexander Eblen ~ https://www.sothebys.com/en/about/team/alexander-eblen

All three have access to Tania Rocks ~ https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aEH4XTBgxzpGZ9sbG_KYUUo4TR_h0Ixo2DesAKEWGUw/edit?usp=sharing

Jennifer and Carol are helping me with my rocks here in SF. They are asking Alexander - in NYC - to investigate your rocks.

And all three may get a taste of you here: http://taniabecker.blogspot.com/. I seem to have let the https://taniabecker.com link go astray somewhere. ;-(

Today I edited the Google Docs spreadsheet so that it is easier to add text in the notes column.

Tania: please do add notes that you feel may be of interest. Please do indicate the family member of origin for each peep so I can add their Wikipedia entry or whatever. If we come up with good stuff, there could be better coverage in a catalog. And for me, the goal is always to leave tasty bait for the historian of the future.

Everyone: I have enabled the ability to add comments to the document, so do feel free to ask questions.

Everyone: please do use "reply all". And please ensure that ace-it@groups.io is included to the "To" list so my daughters and our mail server all receive a copy.

Tania: please do include the two clips from Mummie that I have loaned to you, lo those many decades ago. Did you ever ever wear them? ;-)

I seek to employ a person part-time with experience that may resonate with your technical & arts & life background. I do understand that you are employed full-time at UCSF, nonetheless my intuition tells me you will have good insights and contacts if I share the full scope of the project(s) with you. Here are brief bullets regarding the task:

* Would you kindly help me write a good job description?
* I need help with doing much more than I can do by myself
* The goals are noble; the details innumerable
* The description of the job is important
* It's the mission and vision of the position
* It's the "rule book" when there is a problem

Abraham Lincoln was quoted as saying “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” A well-conceived, fully discussed job description is axe that needs sharpening hee.

If you are interested and have some time to share: kindly let me know what you charge by the hour; I will start to prepare a detailed job description for you to comment on and improve; I will send you a down-payment.

If you feel a task like this is not to your liking, might you recommend someone for me to talk to just tp prepare a job description?
