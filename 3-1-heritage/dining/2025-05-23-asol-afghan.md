## Afghan Youth Mentoring (AYM) Program

We are excited to launch the Afghan Youth Mentoring (AYM) Program (March - December 2025), a vital initiative supporting Afghan refugee youth (ages 15-24) as they navigate new opportunities and challenges in our community. Through mentorship, education, and recreational activities, we aim to provide the tools and encouragement these young individuals need to thrive.

## The Five Pillars Organization

The 5ive Pillars Organization is an Afghan-American led 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that aids in the resettlement of newcomer migrants in Northern California.

We also engage Afghan newcomer families through inclusive digital outreach in English, Farsi and Pashto to better communicate state services and public health/safety messaging to the newcomer community. 

We also offer programs on mental health wellness and digital connectivity for migrant newcomers of Afghan descent, particularly for those who resettled in the U.S. after August 2021.
