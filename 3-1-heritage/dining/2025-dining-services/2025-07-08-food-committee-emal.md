# 2025-07-08 Food Committee Email

Hello Ange, Sylvie and Mary Liz

Below are some points I would like to raise at Tomorrow's Food Committee meeting. It's easier to answer questions if you know the questions early.

## Nitrites in Processed Foods

After enduring a colectomy because of cancer in 2015, I was advised to avoid eating foods with nitrites in them.

I bring this up now because some recent studies have been featured in the news.

Some of these articles have scary but mis-leading headlines: "There Is No Safe Amount of Processed Meat To Eat".

Nonetheless, processed meats, such as hot dogs, are very much a part of a typical American diet. For food suppliers such as Sysco and Safeway, processed meats are a bedrock of their balance sheet. for market-driven service providers such as Morrison, I feel sure that nutrition guidance that includes processed meat is an acceptable risk.

The menus here at Heritage make this not really a problem.

I raise the issue of nitrite and processed meats only to keep my conscience clear. There are risks. The more people know about them, The healthier their diets may become.

Hello Ange, Sylvie and Mary Liz,

Below are some points I would like to raise at Tomorrow's Food Committee meeting. It will be easier to answer questions if you know the issues beforehand.

## Nitrites in Processed Foods

After my 2015 colectomy for cancer, I was advised to avoid nitrites in food. Recent studies have renewed attention on this issue:

### Key Points

While headlines like "There Is No Safe Amount of Processed Meat To Eat" are attention-grabbing, the reality is more nuanced. Processed meats remain central to American diets and food service economicsâ€”suppliers like Sysco and Safeway depend on them, and market-driven providers like senior dining facilities will likely continue including them.

Heritage's current menus make it easy (and a pleasure) to avoid this issue. However, I wanted to raise awareness of the risks so our community can make informed dietary choices.

## Special Requests Form on Community Apps

Is it okay if I ask Front Office/Melissa to create a special request form on Community Apps? This would be similar to the food comments form on there now.

## French wine and cheese tasting on July 16

We are planning for four cheeses and four wines for a maximum of 16 people (but it may be more).

I hope that Dining Service We'll be able to supply four glasses and plates for sliced up the cheeses and accompaniments such as quince paste and cornichons.

I also hope that Dining Service will be able to help with things such as setting the tables, pouring the wine, and slicing the cheese.

It would also be nice to have decorations for the table. And these might be readily available because of the Bastille Day dinner.

I am planning for the cheeses to be delivered on Monday, but could do it earlier if requested.

## "One More Thing"

See you tomorrow!
