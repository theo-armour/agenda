# 2023-09-13 Town hall ~ message to Charlie and Leslie

Hello Charlie and Leslie,

This morning the HotM exec staff held a town hall meeting in FriendShip Hall.

As has been the case at every recent resident meeting with staff, Tony Hanley snarled to Mary "How much are we going to save with the toilet paper?" After a few more remarks in the same vein, Mary left the meeting and did not return. Apparently she left the building later and was heard to exclaim something like "I will never come back here".

My opinion: Tony is bullying or hounding Mary into resigning.

Obviously the dynamic is way more complex than this brief summary. I would very much appreciate some time with you to discuss this sad state of affairs and how to deal with it.

Theo
