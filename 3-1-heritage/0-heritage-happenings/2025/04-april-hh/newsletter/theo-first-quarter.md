# The First Quarter

Itâ€™s been a complicated first quarter for team members. 
The 100th anniversary of the Julia Morgan Building was such a great success that it will need its own issue to portray it in detail.
In furtherance of the Strategic Plan, the Environmental Impact Report is complete. The consultants are progressing to the next step: requesting planning permission from the San Francisco Planning to demolish the Corridor and Health Center and replace them with two new buildings.
The new Yardi accounting system is beginning to be quite operational. Many more operations will be digital, paperwork is being reduced, and we are beginning to get the numbers that will help residents, particularly those on the Type C contract, begin to understand how much their future life will cost.
Fingers crossed: as and when the financial upgrade operation begins to wind down there will be more staff time to devote to information technology that may be beneficial to residents. This could include support for mailing lists, server space for this newsletter and better communications in general.

It has been a challenging first quarter for Heritage on the Marina team members.
The 100th anniversary celebration of the Julia Morgan Building was such a tremendous success that it merits its own issue to explore it in depth.
In support of the Strategic Plan, the Environmental Impact Report is complete. The consultants are now moving to the next phase: seeking planning permission from San Francisco to demolish the Corridor and Health Center and replace them with two new buildings.
The new Yardi accounting system is becoming fully operational. More processes are shifting to digital, paperwork is being reduced, and th financial team are starting to compile figures that will help residents, particularly those on the Type C contract, understand the projected costs of their future living.
Fingers crossed: as the financial upgrade effort winds down, additional staff time should become available for IT projects that benefit residents. This might include enhanced support for mailing lists, dedicated server space for this newsletter, and improved overall communications.
