# Healthy Relationships

By Theo Armour

When I think of the seventy-five residents at Heritage on the Marina, I think of the many relationships we have with each other. Some are close friends, some are acquaintances, and some are people we see in passing. On the whole, my feeling is that the great majority of residents have as many relationships as they want.

What about our relationships with others?

## Henderson Clinic Staff

On the whole, relationships with team members are friendly and cordial. If there is one aspect that could use work, it is that residents sometimes do not understand that Henderson Clinic staff have different roles and responsibilities. There are registered nurses (RN), licensed vocational nurses (LVN), and certified nursing assistants (CNA). Each of these roles has different training and responsibilities. Some are full-time and some are agency staff. It is not easy to keep track of who is who and who is able to do what. This can be especially tricky and frustrating for new residents, residents who have cognitive issues and particularly for friends and family members who are not familiar with the staff.

Learn the differences yourself and be able to explain them to others. This will help you, fellow residents, and your family understand the roles of the staff and what they can do for you.

# Family and Friends

I try hard to have my daughters and friends meet and get to know residents and staff. Fingers crossed that when it comes time for my celebration of life that all you will attend and be able to share stories about me. But closer at hand, as and when the issues aging take their toll on me, I hope my family will be able to use my fellow residents as a resource and support system.

# Neighbors in the Marina

We seem to have so much fun here that we hardly get to know any of our neighbors. I find this interesting as when I walk around the neighborhood I se so many people in out age group that look like nice people. I am slowly building up connections with Next Village an organization that helps old people age in place. They have resources we don’t have and vice versa.

# Healthy Relationships

When I think of the seventy-five residents at Heritage on the Marina, I consider the many connections we share. Some are close friends, some are acquaintances, and some are individuals we see in passing. Overall, I believe the vast majority of residents enjoy as many relationships as they desire.

What about our relationships with others?

## Henderson Clinic Staff

Generally, interactions with team members are warm and friendly. One area for improvement is that residents sometimes do not realize that Henderson Clinic staff hold different roles and responsibilities. There are registered nurses (RN), licensed vocational nurses (LVN), and certified nursing assistants (CNA), each with distinct training and duties. Some work full-time while others are agency staff. It can be challenging to keep track of who is who and what they can do—especially for new residents, those with cognitive challenges, and family or friends unfamiliar with the staff.

Take time to learn the differences and explain them to others. This understanding will benefit you, your fellow residents, and your family by clarifying each staff member’s role and capabilities.

# Family and Friends

I make a concerted effort to introduce my daughters and friends to both residents and staff. I hope that, when the time comes to celebrate my life, you will all be there to share your memories. More immediately, as the challenges of aging gradually affect me, I trust that my family will be able to lean on my fellow residents as a resource and a support network.

# Neighbors in the Marina

We have so much fun here that we rarely get to know our neighbors. I find this intriguing, as I often see many people in our age group around the neighborhood who appear to be kind and welcoming. I am slowly forging connections with Next Village, an organization that assists seniors in aging in place. They offer resources we lack, and we, in turn, provide what they need.
