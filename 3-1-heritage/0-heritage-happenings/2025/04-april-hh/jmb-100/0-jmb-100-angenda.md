Hi Mary
Thanks for your speech.
I am planning a special edition of the Heritage Happenings dedicated to the Julia Morgan Building 100th.
Inclusions
* Your and my speeches
* I will ask Randy and Carolyn and Laura if they have any remarks to share
* Images of the three recognitions
* A selection of Marco's photos
* An introductory article mentioning all relevant parties
* Perhaps ten pages total
I hope to share a draft in the next few days 
Questions
* Should I email Max? (Sherrill) or Frankie (Stefani) or Laura (Pelosi) to see if they might have words to share?
* What should I do to get images of the recognitions?
* Is there anything else you would like to see included?


Cheers,
Theo
