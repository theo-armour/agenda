What is remembered ~ Lives
The default color for the Heritage Happenings newsletter is the same word as the Heritage on the Marina WiFi password. “redbricks1”. 
When I hear the word, see the color, enter the password, I am reminded of the red bricks of the Julia Morgan Building. When I think of the Julia Morgan Building, I am reminded of our lives here. When I think of our lives here, I think of all the people that have come here to complete their lives.
When I think of all the people who came here, I think of all the breakfast, lunches & dinners that have been served, the dressings that have been changed, the songs played in the piano in the parlor, the bills that have been paid, the city inspections that have been carried out, the number of Board meetings held in the Stucky Parlor and many more flashes of visions of life here.
Have there really been four hundred quarterly Board meetings? 
The images in my brain seem to be timeless. They could be past present or future visions.
The text and pictures you will see here are of just one special day. A day commemorating all the regular days. Past, present and — very much — the future.

What Does a Century Mean?

As we celebrate the centenary of the Julia Morgan Building is worth remarking on both changes and consistency.

Just over a hundred years ago, the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society was undergoing yet another pivot. The old premises having served as an orphanage for over 50 years, was no longer being federally funded. The board of directors decided to re-imagine as an operation for elderly and infirm women.

Over 36,750 days later, many more changes have occurred. Nonetheless something like one hundred ten thousand breakfasts, lunches and dinners have been served in this building.

One cannot begin to imagine how many people have chatted with a nurse while taking pills, had their apartment cleaned by housekeeping or had a picture hung by maintenance. All this consistently over a hundred years.

Being able to deal with change and yet remain consistent is a hallmark of the Society. It is a tribute to the board of directors, the staff and the volunteers who have made this possible.

It is also a tribute to Julia Morgan, the architect who designed this building. She designed a structure that has withstood the test of time and has been able to adapt to the changing needs of the Society.

It is time for another pivot. May the Board, residents and staff embrace the changes and maintain the consistency that has been the hallmark of the Society for the past one hundred years.

A Century of Care: Celebrating the Julia Morgan Building
As we mark the centenary of the Julia Morgan Building, we reflect on a remarkable blend of change and constancy.

A century ago, the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society pivoted. After serving as an orphanage for over 50 years, federal funding ceased. The board repurposed the premises to care for elderly and infirm women, commissioning Julia Morgan to design a building fit for this new purpose.

Over the ensuing 36,500+ days, while many changes have occurred, the core mission of care has remained. Imagine: roughly 110,000 breakfasts, lunches, and dinners served within these walls. Countless interactions – chats with nurses, apartments cleaned, pictures hung – represent the consistent dedication across the decades.

This ability to adapt while maintaining steadfast service is the Society's hallmark, a testament to the enduring vision of successive boards, staff, and volunteers. It also honors Julia Morgan, whose design created a structure that has gracefully weathered time and adapted to evolving needs.

Now, as another pivot approaches, may the Board, residents, and staff embrace the future with the same blend of flexibility and consistency that has defined this institution for the past one hundred years.
