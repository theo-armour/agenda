A Century of Care: Celebrating the Julia Morgan Building
As we mark the centenary of the Julia Morgan Building, we reflect on a remarkable blend of change and constancy.

A century ago, the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society pivoted. After serving as an orphanage for over 50 years, federal funding ceased. The board repurposed the premises to care for elderly and infirm women, commissioning Julia Morgan to design a building fit for this new purpose.

Over the ensuing 36,500+ days, while many changes have occurred, the core mission of care has remained. Imagine: roughly 110,000 breakfasts, lunches, and dinners served within these walls. Countless interactions – chats with nurses, apartments cleaned, pictures hung – represent the consistent dedication across the decades.

This ability to adapt while maintaining steadfast service is the Society's hallmark, a testament to the enduring vision of successive boards, staff, and volunteers. It also honors Julia Morgan, whose design created a structure that has gracefully weathered time and adapted to evolving needs.

Now, as another pivot approaches, may the Board, residents, and staff embrace the future with the same blend of flexibility and consistency that has defined this institution for the past one hundred years.
