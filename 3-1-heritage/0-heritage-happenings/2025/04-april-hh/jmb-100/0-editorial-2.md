As we celebrate the centenary of the Julia Morgan Building is worth remarking on both change and consistency.

Just over a hundred years ago, the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society was undergoing yet another pivot. The old premises having served as an orphanage for over 50 years, was no longer being federally funded. The board of directors decided to re-imagine the operation for elderly and infirm women.

Over 36,750 days later, many more changes have occurred. Nonetheless something like one hundred ten thousand breakfasts, lunches and dinners have been served in this building.
