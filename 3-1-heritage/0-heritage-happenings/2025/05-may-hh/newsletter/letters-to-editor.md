I was intrigued to read Fred Wentker’s article entitled The Population Bomb.

Fred writes that “Population growth did continue until the turn of the last century. Then something unexpected happened. Growth stalled, and from then to now it has declined”.

I find the wording a bit confusing. The population of the world in 2000 was about 6 billion, and now it is 8 billion, so the population has not declined, it increased by 33%, just in 25 years, and it continues to increase each year by close to 1%. https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/.

The global fertility rate in 2024 was 2.2, above the the 2.1 replacement level mentioned by Fred. Encouraging immigration from countries with higher fertility rates to those with lower fertility rates would be one solution. https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/sites/www.un.org.development.desa.pd/files/undesa_pd_2025_wfr-2024_advance-unedited.pdf#page9

A variety of policies intended to support families and balance family and work life are available. These include mandating employers to provide paid parental leave and flexible working arrangements, supporting affordable childcare and housing, ensuring the provision of comprehensive care for the older population, and encouraging an equal distribution of caregiving and household responsibilities between men and women.
