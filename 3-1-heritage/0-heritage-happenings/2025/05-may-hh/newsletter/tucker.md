Via con Dios, My Darlin

Surely, we all remember those delightful words played and sung so well by Les Paul and Mary Ford. "Via Con Dios, my darlin'" Go with God, my sweetheart, go with me into eternity.

Then there was the preppy Tijuana Brass with Herbs Alpert's joyful trumpets accompanied by cheering crowds at the bullfight, a mariachi celebration. One didn't have to even cross the border, Mexico was already here. As the Kingston Trio said, "You want green peppers? I'll give you green peppers, Gringo, unless you are in a Tijuana jail and ain't got no bail."

So, fifty years ago, Charmly and I, newly arrived in San Francisco, took it up on ourselves to sighup for a ten-day spring vacation to Old Mexico, to experience enchantment first hand.

First stop, Acapulco. Wow, those young men really did dive off some very high cliffs alright,down, down, down into the forming sea below. But we had to put on our suits and ran down to the golden sandy beach. The water was warm, the beggars not plentiful, no surf, just relaxing. After dinner we returned to our room, noticing the smell of sewage emanating from the bathroom where are suits were drying. Must have been some sewer pipes on the beach, explaining the lack of swimmers.

Also in Acapulco not far away was a colleague of ours with his wife. They returned with paratyphoid. Maybe they drank the water. We did not. 

So if you're going down to Old Mexico, think twice and via con Dios.
