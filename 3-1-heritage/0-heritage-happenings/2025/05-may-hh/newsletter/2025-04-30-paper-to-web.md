Future Issues
By Theo Armour
It is time for me to update the way I edit and publish the Heritage Happenings. I don’t keep a timesheet, but I must spend at least forty hours a month getting out an issue — maybe quite a bit more. In particular, I spend an inordinate amount of time formatting the text and images so they fit on the page as printed on paper. The requirement to create a paper printed document also creates further frustrations. Paper documents are very unfriendly to: 
•	1. Interactivity ~ Users can click, drag, scroll, and fill in forms.
•	2. Multimedia Integration ~ audio clips, animations, and live feeds.
•	3. Real-Time Updates ~ Web pages show live data.
•	4. Personalization ~ adjust based on user behavior or preferences.
•	5. Two-Way Communication ~ comments, chats, purchases.
I have decided to re-focus my efforts to delivering Heritage Happenings primarily in an online interactive manner and letting the paper format become secondary in importance. 
What this means to the distribution and appearance of the paper versions is yet to be determined,

**Future Issues**  
*By Theo Armour*

It’s time to rethink how I edit and publish *Heritage Happenings*. Although I don’t keep a timesheet, each issue easily demands forty-plus hours—much of it spent wrangling text and images into a print-friendly layout.

Print also limits what we can do. Paper pages can’t:

Offer real interactivity—clicking, dragging, scrolling, filling forms  
Embed multimedia—audio clips, animations, live feeds  
Show real-time updates  
Personalize content to each reader  
Enable two-way engagement—comments, chats, purchases  

So I’m shifting focus: *Heritage Happenings* will move primarily to an interactive online format, with print becoming a secondary, archival version. What this means for the look and distribution of the paper copy is still to be determined.
