# Margaret Johnson's Father

My fatther was the youngest of five children in a Quaker family in a southern New Jersey small town. I don’t think I can write about him without writing about his family. He and his three brothers lived together on the top floor of the house in the middle of Salem amid the the accumulation of young men at the turn of the century . a treasure trove to my sister and me after they all moved on. There was a bicycle with a huge front wheel and a small rear wheel hanging on one wall. I always wondered how one could get on  it, let alone ride it. There were fencing foils and Indian bows and arrows and paint pots left behind by the Leni Lenape who had lived in the area. A collapsable top hat for the dandies.
My grandfather and his brother founded one of the two banks in town and my father worked in it all his life in one capacity or another….from errand boy and janitor to President and Chairman of the Board.

Even though a small child at the time, I felt the tension in the house during the 1929 crash, with my father spending very late nights making  sure the Federal Reserve Bank in Philadelphia would lend the bank the money necessary to withstand a run on the bank. He was sucessful and I was told years later, when I was working in a large bank in Philadelphia, what a very good banker he was.

My father and one of his older brothers, George, lived together for a number of years in a cottage on the shore of the Delaware River. Then he met the woman he subsequentjy married when they were both 39. It was a very happy marriage, until she developed cancer and died,

I was 15 at the time; my sister had married and now lived in Vermont, so my father and I had a couple of years together before I went off to boarding school. He got trapped by a predatory widow who thought he must have lots of money. When he told her didn’t, she didn’t believe him and when she realized he was right, she made life very difficult for him.
I loved him dearly and was saddened by his troubles but unable to help him, He died at age 74. I still miss him and his quiet sense of humor.
