Hello Heritage Happenings Editorial Committee Members

I hope you are all warming up your typing fingers. Holidays or not, the printing presses must roll!

It's time for our monthly meeting. How about this Tuesday, December24 at 4pm in the McGinley Room?

By the way, here are Angie's countries of the month for the first quarter of 2025:

January will be Egypt; February will be China and March will be Ireland.

Cheers,

Theo
