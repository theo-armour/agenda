"How's the craic?

That’s a common Irish greeting, translating roughly to “How’s the fun?” As we know how much fun it can be contributing to your Heritage Happenings monthly newsletter, we welcome your submissions for March!

You may have guessed that March Happenings will transport us to Ireland — land of verdant landscapes, pints of Guinness, leprechauns (perhaps?), cliffs and crumbling castles.

So you’re spoiled for choice, we’ve come up with a bevy of prompts for you to work from. Please choose one (or more!), write your heart out, and deliver it to me by Date TBA.

No need to write a Ulysses-length tome! Most of our stories are 1 or 2 pages, and we’ll happily accept a shorter anecdote, memory, joke, folklore, recipe, etc.

Writing Prompts for March, Ireland:

* Your Irish Family: Stories about family members with Irish roots or memorable family reunions.
* Your Irish Memories: Anecdotes from visits to Ireland, festive celebrations, or personal experiences with Irish traditions.
* Irish Recipes: Whether it’s a time-honored family dish or a modern twist on a classic, we’d love to learn about your favorite Irish culinary delights.
* Favorite Irish Author, Book, or Poem: Share recommendations or personal reflections on literature and poetry that have touched your heart.
* Travel & Landmarks: If you’ve visited Ireland, we’d love to hear about your favorite Irish destination or landmark, along with any amusing travel anecdotes.
* Irish Music & Dance: Do you have a favorite Irish jig, song, or musical memory? Perhaps you’ve danced to lively Irish tunes or attended a memorable performance—let us know!
* Folklore & Legends: Share a beloved Irish myth, fairy tale, or folklore. Whether it’s a humorous leprechaun story or a magical legend, your tale can enchant our readers.
* Crafts & Creativity: Have you ever created Irish-inspired art or crafts? We’d love to see photos of your handiwork or hear about the inspiration behind them.
* Witty Irish Humor: Ireland is known for its wit! Tell us your favorite Irish joke, pun, or clever saying that always brings a smile.
* Festive Celebrations: Did you have a particularly fun or heartwarming experience during a St. Patrick’s Day celebration or another Irish festival? Share your festive memory!
* Irish Language Treasures: Whether it’s a favorite Gaelic word or phrase, or a short sentence that you find charming, we’re curious to know what words capture the Irish spirit for you.
* Personal Mementos: Do you have a special Irish keepsake or souvenir with a story behind it? Your photos and memories can add a personal touch to our feature.

We look forward to reading (and publishing) your submissions!

Cheers,

Theo
