## Training for the Holidays
Tom King

We took a train to Tahoe for Christmas. What a glorious trip through the snowy mountains!

The train was smoother and quieter than I had imagined, and all the Amtrak people were friendly and helpful in spite of this being one of their busiest days of the year. Once the train got past Sacramento into Colfax, the scenery changed from Central Valley yuck to snowy Sierra wonder.

OK, the train actually left from the Emeryville Amtrak Station, and then we got off in Truckee. Our daughter-in-law, Jennifer, met us and chauffeured us from Truckee to their ski place in nearby Martis Camp, where we joined eleven people for the holidays. Here’s a picture of some of the kids and the presents patiently awaiting them under the tree:

Coming back had me driving a rented Jeep Wagoneer with 5 passengers through a snowstorm with chain controls on a busy and slippery I-80. Where’s the train when you need it?

Last November I spent a week in Bordeaux France. Bordeaux is at the heart of one of the best known the French wine producing areas.
Just north of Bordeaux are two of the most famous vineyards, TChateau Mouton Rothschild and Chateau Lafite Rothschild. They are neighboring wine estates owned by separate branches of the Rothschild family.

Expect to pay about $1.000 for a bottle of wine from either of these estates. Their production is limited, and the quality is extremely high. So, over the years their reputation has grown and the wine, when available, is highly sort after. They primarily produce red wine from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and use other types of grapes as well.

A description of the difference of their wines coming from a wine commentator was that Chateau Lafite Rothschild was described as elegant and austere, while Chateau Mouton Rothschild is considered opulent and fruity.

The estates themselves are not very large. Chateau Lafite Rothschild is 112 hectares or about 277 acres. Chateau Mouton Rothschild is 90 hectares or about 222 acres.

The English will refer to red wine as “Claret”. This comes from an old French word “Clairet” which means, clear, light-colored red wine.

In the northern part of the city of Bordeaux is the “Musee Du Vin” – the Museum of wine. You can either take the tram there or go by boat down the river Garonne. There are river departures on a regular basis from the city by a get on get off ferry called “Le Batbus” which will drop you at the Museum of Wine.

There are also many tours to other wineries and Chateaux in the region. Included is a collage of some of these places. The details of which I picked up at the Museum of Wine.

Cairo - September, 1980
By Doris Howard

There are two memories I have of that week. One is walking along the Nile River, where it flows through the city along beautifully designed embankments, moonlight and pale street lights. Beautiful!

The other memory is more mundane. I had heard of people bargaining on foreign bazaars but never thought I would find myself doing it. I was sitting in one - a string of jewelers, waiting while others shopped. I noticed a silver chain in an unusual pattern so got up to look at it. A salesman promptly emerged and offered it for $100. I refused the offer. He said "$80". I said "No. No. I have several silver chains". He said "$60". I said "No". He said "$40". "No." He said "$20". I bought it. I realized I had just done what others had bragged about. I bargained!
I wore the lovely silver chain that evening. When I removed it later, I found a green stain ringed around my neck. Not such a bargain, after all.

## safari in Tanzania

By Margaret Johnson

In 2006, I offered my son Tom, as a 60th birthday present, a trip to anywhere he would like to see, as long as I could go with him. He chose a safari in Tanzania. At 82, that was okay by me! We flew from London to Dar es Salaam, on the way seeing Mt. Kilimanjaro poking above the clouds. At the rather mildewed, chaotic airline terminal we found that no one knew anything about us, which was kind of scary because we thought we were in a tour group. But we were rescued by a man from an internal airline who got us sorted out and onto a single-engine 14-seater headed for Selous Safari Camp, the first of our three camps.

The plane dropped us and our bags at a deserted dirt strip surrounded by scrubby forest (“miombo”), leaving with a cheery, “someone will be by soon to fetch you.” And before we got too nervous about being eaten by wildlife, a jeep did arrive. On the trip to the camp, when we got excited at seeing some impalas and giraffes, we were told to relax— we would see zillions in the next few days, and indeed we did.

Our hosts, a young American couple, introduced us to our guide, our butler, and our houseboy(!), and immediately loaded us onto a boat trip on an oxbow lake of the Rufiji River. The trip was fascinating: on the river we saw a herd of hippos (well, ears and nostrils), dozens of crocodiles, and elephants drinking and bathing, and in the woods were impalas, reedbucks, a waterbuck, cape buffaloes, and giraffes. And the birds! Hadada ibis, spoonbills, fish eagles, yellow-billed storks, a goliath heron, egrets, and Egyptian geese to name just a few. We saw as much wildlife in two hours as we had hoped to see in a week. An impressive start! That afternoon we went on the first of the numerous game drives of the next nine days, getting up close to a herd of elephants, seeing monkeys, baboons, a hyena, and getting a really great education from the very talented guide.

The whole place had a Polynesian look, with high-pitched thatched roofs. The community rooms - library/bar and dining room - were raised about 10 feet above the ground and open all around with a view of the lake. Our platform-mounted tent cabin was quite comfortable, even luxurious, but when darkness fell that first night we knew we were in the jungle – all night long there were loud snufflings and rustling RIGHT outside the tent as hippos and other large animals foraged through the camp. We were told never to leave the tent for any reason at night, were escorted to and from our tent by Masai staff, and provided with a whistle to call for help if needed. After the morning bird chorus our butler would arrive with a tray of coffee and biscuits balanced on his head for us to enjoy on our porch. It was very exotic.

Highlights of our Selous experience included our first baobob tree (a surreal experience – they look as if a thick syrup had been poured on an upside-down tree and then solidified), a group of lion cubs whose parents totally ignored us, an educational walk (our guide carried an elephant gun to “reason with” wildlife), the grave of Captain Selous, killed in WWI leading African militia against German troops, and classic, Hemingway-esque African savannah. Back at camp, we found a young elephant browsing the trees next to our cabin. I suggested that my only son would get a better picture if he walked past the animal to the porch – fortunately, that worked out OK.

The rest of our trip, to safari camps in Mikumi and Ruaha National Parks, was at least as exciting as Selous, and perhaps there can be a second installment of this narrative.

**Book Review: Hampton Sides, *The Wide, Wide Sea***

Was it, by any stretch of the imagination, a justifiable homicide? That’s the question central to *The Wide, Wide Sea* regarding James Cook’s murder on Hawaii in the last quarter of the 18th century. With copious research and a voluminous bibliography, we are left pondering. Among Captain Cook’s officers were William Bligh (*of Mutiny on the Bounty*) and George Vancouver, for whom two cities and one of America’s largest islands are named. Captain James Cook remains as one of history’s most prolific cartographers and explorers who solved some of the world’s most nagging puzzles. At the scene of his death, he would have been understandably exhausted, fatally so, as was Ferdinand Magellan, killed in the Philippine Islands 258 years previously...


**Book Review: *The Wager*, David Grann**

In the final quarter of the 18th century, England, embroiled yet again in war with France and Spain, dispatched a squadron of warships to the east coast of South America with the intent to capture one of the vessels loaded with gold and silver mined in the Andes. The mission succeeded, but in the process, one of its escorts, the *HMS Wager*, was forced by severe weather onto a reef off Chile, where it sank, with most of its crew stranded without help, presumed drowned as collateral damage but barely surviving. Against all odds, David Grann relates the harrowing ordeals of the crewmen as they miraculously return to England in two separate groups, the first around the Horn and into Brazil to avoid Spanish capture, the second northward toward Peru, still Spanish but at peace with England, fortunately.

**Book Review: *Sasquatch* by Jeff Meldrum, Ph.D.**

The persuasive power of legend is thoroughly examined by Jeffery Meldrum, professor of physical anthropology and evolutionary bipedalism at Boise State U. The mythical Bigfoot phenomenon was launched successfully in 1958 by three co-workers on a road construction site, Ray and Shorty Wallace and Rant Mullins, who carved the wooden giant feet so convincingly used to leave the awesome tracks in numerous mountain meadows.

The public supplied ample proof of the Sasquatch with videos, fur samples, scat, and earnest anecdotes. Were the three perpetrators really guilty, or were they merely bringing attention to an actual anthropological mystery? This 275-page book, published by Tom Doherty Assoc. L.L.C., 2006, still leaves readers with the question still enigmatic.

**Two Dead in Pursuit of Sasquatch**

Two men, aged 40 and 60, were found in the mountainous forests of Washington State lying dead days after reported missing by family. They were hunting for the fabled Bigfoot believed haunting the vicinity by many. The local sheriff attributes their deaths to climate change.

The Pyramids of Egypt
By Sheila Moore

I believe I've visited Egypt three times, and 2010 was the second time, but I'm not sure.  Each time I've visited, Egypt does seem to be more developed and prosperous.  I usually stay downtown in some cheap crummy rooming house, and take a local but to Giza, in the outskirts of Cairo, where the famous Pyramids are situated.

(1)  This is the main Pyramid.  It's huge, and about 4,600 years old.

(2)  The outer veneer or cover, has been worn off or weathered off, and the facade is of great blocks of granite.  Years ago, on a previous visit, I paid a man a tip to see him leap up the blocks to the top, and back again.  It's how he made a living.

(3)  For a fee, a visitor can go inside the pyramid, and on one of my trips I did go inside - photos are following.  The Pyramids are huge, 4,600 years old, and one of the Seven Wonders Of The World.

(4) Me on a camel.  But I soon found out the camel had a mind of its own and was strong and twisting around, so I didn't stay on it long.

(5)  Next I visited the Sphinx, which is a little downhill from the Pyramid.  The Sphinx has a feline body of a lion, with the face of Khufu, Cheops in Greek.  It is carved from a single stone.  French troops damaged the Sphinx' face by firing on it.

(6)  Next I took a bus and stayed in Luxor for a few days, which has many ancient temples.  Then I took a local barge and crossed the Nile River, and walked to the Valley Of The Kings.  There were many tombs - here is the entrance to King Tutankhamun's Tomb ($20 entrance fee).

(7)  Inside the inner burial chamber of King Tutankhamun's tomb.  His tomb had several layers - one box inside another.  A golden gilded coffin enclosed his mummy.

(8)  The beautiful gilded mask covering the mummy of King Tutankhamun.

(9)  Full view of the inside coffin covering the mummy of King Tutankhamun.


## Monthly Health Topics / Themes
By Theo Armour

As Anne Morris reminds us, "Growing old is not for sissies." Bette Davis.

Being one of the youngsters around here, I like to think of Heritage as an elite training school for learning to age gracefully. Like any school, the curriculum is broad and deep. Aging well takes into account wide range of topics.

My niece Mia, is helping me with my studies. In her lesson plan, she divides the year into twelve monthly topics of wellness studies. Here are the subjects we will study:

1. Exercise (Mental & Physical)
2. Sleep
3. Eating Well & Hydration
4. Healthy Relationships (with Yourself & Others)
5. Socializing
6. Hobbies, Passions, Inspiration
7. Financial Fitness
8. Advanced Planning
9. Fall Prevention
10. Medication Management
11. Community Engagement
12. Your Legacy

I will share my homework with you in the newsletter. I hope you'll share your thoughts and experiences with me, too.

Also as part of my efforts I hope that Martha, Vada, Brittany, Jonathan, and others will help me with my studies so that I can include their thoughts and experiences in the newsletter.

Practice what you preach
Here is the tricky thing. In school you can turn in your homework and throw it out when you get your grade. But in the school of life, you have to live with the results of your actions. So, I am going to try to practice what I preach. I will share my experiences with you in the newsletter. I hope you'll share your thoughts and experiences with me, too.

Why do you study all this stuff?
One of the things I hear is that as you age life gets more complicated, but it also gets more boring. Residents ask "is playing Solitaire or reading a book again for the tench time the best I can do?" When I look at the list of topics, I think that there is a lot of interesting stuff to learn and think about. My goal is that each month, we can come up with interesting activities.

Goals, Targets, and Indicators
Speaking of goals, Having an objective, being able to say "I want..." is where it starts. If you don't want anything, aren't you just a bystander in life.



Together, we can make this the best school ever!


Nbody wants to study everything all at once, my plan ids to focus on one subject each month. I'll be sharing what I learn with you in the newsletter. I hope you'll share your thoughts and experiences with me, too. Together, we can make this the best school ever!
