## Shiela Moo~ My 17 Day Tour Of China in 1996

On all my  trips around the world I travelled alone, on foot or local buses, but when I turned to China, I decided to go on an escorted tour because China was so vast, and I do not speak Chinese.  I signed up for a Rim-Pac International China tour, and that was a very good decision, it was an all-inclusive $3,000 but that included airfare SF-Beijing-Shanghai-SF, all food & transportation.

During our tour, our Guide described China's "one-child policy" (which has long since been cancelled and is no longer in effect),  She told us "I have one little girl, but she said if she had two, she would lose her job, have to pay the government a fine, and it would be very difficult to get the second child an education."

China Travel—Ups and Downs

It was 1949 and the Cultural Revolution had arrived in China. With it, the door slammed shut on tourism.  China remained off limits for about another 25 years.  It was after Nixon visited the country in 1972 that things changed.  It took until the mid-70s before the  country began to welcome tourists again.  However, in 1973, the Chinese government  allowed  organized groups  of American citizens into the country.  These groups were mostly composed of scholars, journalists and business people. There was no such thing as an individual visa or individual travel.  There were no airlines connecting China and the US directly.

As a travel agent, I had several groups that qualified.  One was a woman’s organization whose purpose was to develop ties with women in different countries. Since I was not a member of the group, I wasn’t allowed to join them, but I could accompany them to Hong Kong, the city from which they were to depart.  They were required to make the almost 100-mile journey by train from Hong Kong to Canton (now Guangdong) to start their trip.

We had to make all arrangements with China Travel Service, the government agency.  It wasn’ t easy or smooth.  When we arrived in Hong Kong, I went to the agency’s office to pick up the train tickets. There were 15 ladies in the group but only 14 tickets-- of course.   Eventually I returned to the hotel with the tickets in hand. At least the first leg of their trip was in hand.

It was so rare for Americans to be traveling to China that when it was known the one of the daughters of General Joe Stillwell was in the group, the press requested an interview.  Very kindly she asked me to sit in.  The only press interview I’ve ever experienced.

Of course, when China began to develop the infrastructure for tourism. it boomed just as the economy was growing exponentially.   That is until Covid when the country shut down for three years.  And still tourism is not back to what it was in 2019.

Cooby Goodway

By Martha Nell Beatty

Cooby lived  on Long Island  until 1949 when the family moved to Washington, D.C.  When she was nine, Cooby’s father’s job  took them to  Greece for two years. She says they were the best years of her life since she was at an age before concerns about boyfriends and serious homework. The family lived in a suburb of Athens, where Cooby and her friends, one of whom was Frederica von Stade, had lots of freedom and could travel around the area on their bicycles.

 On weekends the family would visit places like Delphi and Corinth.  They called it  “climbing on the rocks.” Or her father might take the family on his day-sailor boat to some of the islands.  There were almost no tourists at the time so the family could enjoy historical and beautiful sites  almost to themselves.

She attended the Anglo-American School and although classes were in English, Cooby did manage to pick up some Greek.   They studied Aeschylus, Sophocles and  Euripides  regularly.   Cooby was  fascinated that these learned men were questioning why there were so many gods.

After Greece, the family returned to DC.   Except for boarding school and college, Cooby lived in the city until coming to San Francisco and The Heritage last November.

Cooby was involved in diverse activities in Washington.  In 1965, she was the fifth person on the payroll of what would become the Kennedy Center.   Her duties included running special projects pre-opening.  After the Center opened there was no longer a job for her, so she switched gears completely and started a job as assistant to the director of Environmental Health Administration for the city of Washington.   She soon learned many issues about the city including the war on rats.

A major concern was with the inner-city highway system that was threatening Washington as well as many cities across the country.  Cooby  had done a paper for Ralph Nader on who was backing the project and found  to her surprise that AAA  was one of the organizations.  In her job, Cooby attended monthly District of Columbia Highway Commission meetings, where they were joined by members of  the Federal Highway Commission. She learned speed writing so that she could take minutes to share with lawyers fighting the highway system.

Cooby then went on to work as a volunteer for the Smithsonian archives, which she gave time to for 25 years. Her project was working on a gargantuan collection of sheet music, which had been donated to the Smithsonian.  The music was organized by subject.   One subject might be geography and another food.  One of her favorites was “Never Hit your Grandma with a Shovel. It Makes Bad Impression on Her Mind.”

One of Cooby’s two daughters relocated to Wisconsin recently and  her other daughter and  family live three blocks from The Heritage. With no family left in Washington, Cooby decided to move to San Franciso.  She is now available for baby sitting her three young grandsons!



## Cooby ~ Beirut


For the three Fall months of 1969 I lived in Beirut, Lebanon, for the purpose of auditing courses at the
American University of Beirut, in teaching early education. Good idea, but stuff happens.
A cousin, and a couple of friends were in the Embassy, so right away I was seeing around town and into the
country side.  And to Syria, Egypt, and Jordan.  Fabulous!
BUT one of my best memories is the evening a group of us went out to dinner, after which we went around the corner to a bar.
Right as we walked in, I saw two men at a backgammon table on my immediate left.  They had just
finished a game and one  of the two men was leaving.  The other guy was looking around the bar for
someone to play with, and I turned to my left and said that I'd like to play.
He did not stand up and bow or scrape; just sat there and said the equivalent of "OK".
My friends all went to a table and sat down.
The man and I started playing.
I won.
The man's face tightened dramatically.
He slowly stood up.
He took up the dice in a very tight fist and threw the dice across the bar room floor.
And walked out.
I rejoined my friends.
