## Cooby ~ Beirut


For the three Fall months of 1969 I lived in Beirut, Lebanon, for the purpose of auditing courses at the
American University of Beirut, in teaching early education. Good idea, but stuff happens.
A cousin, and a couple of friends were in the Embassy, so right away I was seeing around town and into the
country side.  And to Syria, Egypt, and Jordan.  Fabulous!
BUT one of my best memories is the evening a group of us went out to dinner, after which we went around the corner to a bar.
Right as we walked in, I saw two men at a backgammon table on my immediate left.  They had just
finished a game and one  of the two men was leaving.  The other guy was looking around the bar for
someone to play with, and I turned to my left and said that I'd like to play.
He did not stand up and bow or scrape; just sat there and said the equivalent of "OK".
My friends all went to a table and sat down.
The man and I started playing.
I won.
The man's face tightened dramatically.
He slowly stood up.
He took up the dice in a very tight fist and threw the dice across the bar room floor.
And walked out.
I rejoined my friends.
