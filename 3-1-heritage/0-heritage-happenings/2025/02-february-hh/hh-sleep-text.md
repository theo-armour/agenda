# Sleep


## Betty Dy

I learned long ago to go to bed at the same time and get up at the same time.  It takes effort, but it works.  Also, no heavy meal before retiring.  Better not to nap on the bed, only a chair for resting.

Val said that if she drinks coffee at night she can't sleep.Â  I said I have the exact opposite problem: if I'm asleep I can't drink coffee.

### Sleep or Not to Sleep

Chronic insomnia led me to daily (or nightly) use of sleeping medication. It helped some but not a lot, so I recently stopped taking it. Two results followed. One was a rebound of daily energy. The sleeping pill had been giving me hangovers. The second change was in my heart. I had been experiencing palpitations for about the same number of years as I had used sleep medication. The palpitations came to an abrupt end. I still have insomnia but I no longer have heart palpitations and I now have levels of energy I have not had in years.

The the best way to get to sleep is to have a clear conscience
