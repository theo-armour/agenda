# Sleep

## First page

The text is intended to kind of look like Chinese calligraphy. Again, I tried AI but it took too long. Luckily I found and downloaded a free font that achieves the effect. The name of the font is, heh heh, “Wonton”. And fonts that look Chinese are called “chop suey” fonts.
The primary focus of this newsletter is to help us older people to continue to be active writers. It’s not the readership that counts, it’s the “writership”! And your job, as our reader, is to spot the issues and naïve biases and report where we are being naughty or something. Even better, send a letter to the editor or submit an article of your own. And try to make us smile. ;-)

I learned long ago to go to bed at the same time and get up at the same time.  It takes effort, but it works.  Also, no heavy meal before retiring.  Better not to nap on the bed, only a chair for resting.

Val said that if she drinks coffee at night she can't sleep.  I said I have the exact opposite problem: if I'm asleep I can't drink coffee.

## Doris ~ To Sleep or Not to Sleep

Chronic insomnia led me to daily (or nightly) use of sleeping medication. It helped some but not a lot, so I recently stopped taking it. Two results followed. One was a rebound of daily energy. The sleeping pill had been giving me hangovers. The second change was in my heart. I had been experiencing palpitations for about the same number of years as I had used sleep medication. The palpitations came to an abrupt end. I still have insomnia but I no longer have heart palpitations and I now have levels of energy I have not had in years.

The the best way to get to sleep is to have a clear conscience
