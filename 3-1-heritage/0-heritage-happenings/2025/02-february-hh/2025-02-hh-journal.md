## 2025-01-20 ~ February Heritage Happenings

Greetings Heritage Happenings Editorial Committee Members

As usual, this invitation comes out later rather than earlier. Sorry.

Anyway, If you are available, how about we meet Tuesday, 21 January in the McGinley Room at 4:30?

Trish and Mia: I do not expect you will attend, but I will keep you in the loop.

In February the country of the month is China, the health topic is Sleep, the festivities include Dancing with the Lions and Valentines day. It's Black History Month and Presidents Day will be observed.

Fingers crossed: The printing date is 31 January. This means draft copies of your efforts will be much appreciated if you send them in by this Sunday 25 January.

Cheers,

Theo
