Dear Residents,
I hope this message finds you well and that you had a joyful and rest-ful December. I know the holiday season can be busy, but I trust that you have had moments of re-laxation and reflection.
As we close out 2024, I want to express my sincere gratitude for our dedicated team of leaders and staff, whose compassion and care for our residents continue to shine. We are proud to have completed a deficiency-free survey from the Department of Social Services, es-pecially given that Aging in Place is still a relatively new concept in California. We are honored to be at the forefront of this important movement. We are also making great strides with our new Yardi software, which will soon support our finance, human resources, maintenance, and nursing depart-ments. Additionally, we are on track to secure our land use per-mit. Finally, we are thrilled to share that our application for Landmark status for the Julia Mor-gan building has been approved. We expect to receive formal desig-nation from the new Mayor in the coming weeks. Finally, last week we sent out an email blast to resi-dents and neighbors with an up-dated FAQ about our strategic plan. This can also be found on our website under “future plans.”
Looking ahead to 2025, I am hope-ful that we will continue to engage in respectful and meaningful con-versations. It is a privilege to serve the Heritage community, and I deeply appreciate the active in-volvement of our residents.
Here are a few important events:
January 22, 2025, at 10:00 AM: We will hold a special financial meeting to address questions re-garding our status as a 501(c)(3) private charity. Per your requests, we will have legal counsel and a tax accountant present. We will al-so provide an update on savings and expenses following the closure of the SNF (skilled nursing facility) on April 1, 2023. Board members have been invited to attend.
February 12, 2025, at 10:00 AM: Our semiannual meeting will be held to discuss the 2025 budg-et, resident fee increases, and other community updates.
March 27, 2025, from 2:00 to 4:00 PM: We will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Julia Morgan building with a special event. This will be an opportunity to showcase our community to lo-cal residents and politicians and will also serve as a fundraising event.
On behalf of our staff and myself, I wish you all a Happy New Year. May the year ahead bring you good health, happiness, and peace.
Warm regards,

Mary Linde
Chief Executive Officer
