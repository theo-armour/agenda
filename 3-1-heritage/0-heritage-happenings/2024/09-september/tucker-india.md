# India and the Willing Suspension of Disbelief

By Tucker Ingham

As Samuel Taylor Coleridge said, a truly good piece of artistry allows its author some leeway with truth, as "In Xanadu did Kublai Khan a stately pleasure dome decree..." And we as audience regularly indulge in that pleasure: Art for art's sake. We allow fantasy in popular film, especially, and really miss its absence if somehow removed from the original version.

In George Lucas' story about teen hot-rodders (_American Graffiti_, 1974) at a Mel's Drive-in, for example, the most hilariously unlikely teenage pranks against vindictive cops is completely cut in its TV version. A kid hooks a cable to the squad car's rear axle, the other end is tied around a small fire hydrant to the rear. When a couple of noisy hotrods go speeding by, the cops take the bait. The rear axle detaches, the fire hydrant erupts in a geyser. The audience in theaters all across the country is in stitches.

Similarly, in a popular male vs female film, Jack Nicholson is the epitome of a failed middle-aged "Mr Cool". He finally succeeds in taking Shirley MacLaine out to lunch, picking her up, in his testosterone-macho way, in a brand new stingray with a sliding glass roof hatch and they speed off down the road and Nicholson, smartly opens the hatch above. In the original version, Shirley's massively coiffed hairdo then that seems to explode skyward. Audience roars. TV version omits this punch line,in inexplicably, a bungled, willing suspension opportunity.

India was a place 60 years ago where one was not required to willingly suspend one's disbeliefs. It had only recently cut itself loose from colonialism and foreign occupation. As Britain pulled out, much of Kipling's world remained, and it remained as unbelievable, and suspended before one's eyes. Large and elegant white Brahma bulls roamed the squalid marketplaces as their holy status allowed. When they copiously relieved themselves of warm and steamy bulk, almost instantly a sarong-clad women would gather her prize to plop it on her head gracefully (to use as fire fuel or wall patch.)

Over-population was everywhere very noticeable with street beggars ubiquitous throughout public properties. At Benares, where the dead were cremated on wooden pyres, ashes were cast into the rolling Ganges on their way to reincarnation or perhaps Nirvana if one had respected one's Dharma enough. To assist one searching for perfection, magic charms were sold by fervent apostles of mystery, none of whom appeared to be well-fed but maybe chronically next to emaciation. The hooded cobra is an evil and ominous presence on the pavement swaying menacingly to the faint melody played on a pipe. Children sit beside infants, sit beside begging adults like ransoms, crying for mercy, some obviously infirm. Some adults suffer from Leprosy missing toes and fingers, the disease that deadens nerves, allowing wounds to fester.

To flee such prevalent miseries, the British had built homes in the Himalayan foothills reachable by coal-fired steam engine on narrow-gauge track. These were especially appreciated during the hot season, with large hotels available to the fortunate. Rhododendron forests spotted the rails. An unexpected perk was the presence in these villages of swarms of monkeys which rudely would climb the Hotel walls and enter any open window available, stealing anything that glittered, or not. They appeared to be quite territorial and could glare and bare their teeth if bothered. It is unlikely the Brits could shoot the intruders since the monkeys enjoyed holy status as evidenced by the many shrines up town. Shrines offer hope.

There is an island in the bay of Bombay named called Elephanta, containing no elephants and surrounded with waters home to flying fish. Beneath the ground in the caves of Elephanta lie ancient deities, of both genders, carved in stone impressively large and explicit.

Starkly present: overwhelming poverty comma disparities in wealth comma homelessness comma and misery in a land beyond its capacities due to overpopulation and its willingness to accept what others would choose to disbelieve.It is all there, starkly present.


## Morris Grassfed Beef: An Enduring Holistic Legacy

In anticipation of our September 15 Dining Services special luncn menu selrection of beef sliders from Morris Grassfed cattle ranch, it seems fitting to share the history and holistic program of Morris Grassfed, as well as the rich California tradition of caring for our land and animals.
Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, Morris cattle drink clean water and eat lush grass. This not only makes for happy cows, it helps convert sunlight and rain into deep-rooted plants, storing carbon and water in the soil.
When you purchase and eat locally raised grass-fed beef, you’re doing more than nourishing your body and the land. Thriving family farms and ranches are the backbone of many rural communities; providing open space, wildlife habitat, jobs and business opportunities for the community. Morris manage the land to benefit the whole ecosystem: air, water, birds, soil, livestock, and people.
The roots of the California meat trade (as we know it) date back to San Francisco in the 1850s. Richard O’Neill — owner of a San Francisco butcher shop during the Gold Rush — formed a partnership with James Flood to buy Rancho Santa Margarita and the T.O. Cattle Company was formed. Realizing the strategic location and value of Santa Margarita, the U.S. took over the ranch, now known as Camp Pendleton, under eminent domain in 1942.
The family moved to San Juan Bautista where they continued the family’s holistic ranching traditions. In 1991, Julie and Joe Morris took over management of the ranch, working to produce relaxed, well-fed cows and a biologically rich, beautiful landscape on the rangelands they call home.


## My love affair with computers
By Margaret Jacobs

My love affair with computers began in 1989. My first day in a new job I entered my office and found an ancient Apple 2E on my desk with floppy discs. It wasn’t on the internet, but it could score the nonverbal tests I administered to Russian immigrants pinpointing their vocational interests
Now a new chapter in this affair has started. I am setting up a relationship with AI, artificial intelligence. Every day or so I will raise a topic or ask a question that has caught my attention. Theo gave me a list of AI sources, and I chose one, Perplexity, for this new venture.
Every day life has a delightful habit of bringing one of these topics to the fore. I subscribe to a website called The Marginalian which brings a wealth of references to thinkers, poets, and others who engage with life’s challenges. Serendipity occurred the week I joined Claudia’s meditation group which centers on practicing the focus on self in the present. The Marginalian topic was loving the self, and included the poem by Derek Walcott titled Love after Love.
I started by asking about how the major religions taught about love for oneself. Perplexity supplied a highly detailed and organized description, differentiating between the Judeo-Christian Love your neighbor as you love yourself and the Buddhist denial of the individual self.
I answered that the injunctions from both move very quickly to compassion for others – love yourself but. The "but" seems to come from fear of a pure self love
in itself, not just because it "should be balanced" by care for others. Below is the
(edited) answer from Perplexity:
You've made an astute observation. (that massaged my ego!) You're right that the "but"
often stems from a deeper, more fundamental fear of pure self-love rather than just a
concern for balance. Let's explore this further:
The resistance to unconditional self-love often comes from several deep-seated fears
and societal conditioning:

1. Fear of Selfishness
2. Cultural and Religious Conditioning
3. Fear of Vulnerability

4. Internalized Unworthiness
5. Fear of Change
6. Societal Pressure

The Truth About Self-Love...In reality, genuine self-love doesn't need to be "balanced"
by care for others because...loving yourself fully doesn't diminish your capacity to care
for others – it enhances it.

Here is the poem that started it all.

LOVE AFTER LOVE
by Derek Walcott
The time will come
when, with elation,
you will greet yourself arriving
at your own door, in your own mirror,
and each will smile at the other’s welcome,
and say, sit here. Eat.
You will love again the stranger who was your self.
Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart
to itself, to the stranger who has loved you
all your life, whom you ignored
for another, who knows you by heart.
Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,
the photographs, the desperate notes,
peel your own image from the mirror.
Sit. Feast on your life.


## Pam and Bob Bledsoe
By Martha Nell Beatty

Pam from the small California town of McCloud and Bob from El Paso, Texas met in Reno.
At nine, Pam wanted to grow up to be a telephone operator. Then at 18, low and behold, through friends she was offered a job at Nevada Bell in Reno as a telephone operator. The friends also had a place for Pam to live.
Bob’s path to Reno wasn’t quite as direct. One summer during college vacation from New Mexico State University, he and a friend were told that an about-to-open Del Webb Resort and Casino at South Lake Tahoe was hiring. When they arrived at Tahoe, they found the hotel was not going to open after all. Instead Bob got a job at the Star Dust Lodge in the area The real plus was free room and board.
A few years later Bob moved to Reno where he transferred to University of Nevada Reno. He also applied for a job at the El Rancho, a family- owned hotel, which had just opened. Bob got the job because he knew how to work a switchboard. The family ended up owning several Reno hotels. Ultimately, Bob became head of sales and marketing for the family’s largest hotel/casino.
Fifteen years later Pam was offered a promotion to AT&T in San Francisco. During her years with the company, she would write training manuals, present stand-up instruction and travel the state training employees.
When the Bledsoes left Reno, Bob thought he would take three months off but instead he had a five- year sabbatical. One activity that engaged him was taking cooking lessons at Judith Ets-Hoken Cooking School in the city. Bob and Pam also spent a year in Kona, Hawaii
When they returned, Bob was offered a position at the Holiday Inn in South San Francisco near the airport. The hotel was part of a large organization that had several hotels in the same area including Ramada Inn and Executive Inn. Ultimately, Bob was managing director over 550 hotel airport rooms.
Pam and Bob decided to move to Sonoma with Pam commuting to work in the city. Bob found a job at Sonoma’s Buena Vista Winery, California’s oldest premium winery. During the five years he was at the winery, the company suffered financial challenges and went through five ownership changes. With the last sale Bob was able to make a smooth transition to working at Jacuzzi Family Vineyards in Sonoma County. Twelve years later, Covid arrived and the tasting room where Bob worked, had to be closed,
For some of the years they were in Sonoma Pam and Bob lived in a senior mobile home park. They were there in 2017, when the Tubbs Wildfire caused great destruction very close to them. Their community had volunteer fire watchers around the clock, while Sonoma County had buses outside the premises to evaluate those without cars. The Bledsoes’ two cars were loaded with their possessions ready to go. It was a terrifying time and they felt they did want to get away from an area with the potential for wildfires.
Two years ago, Pam and Bob decided it was time to move to an assisted living community to make life easier. After visiting several facilities, they choose The Heritage, which is an area in which they had previously lived. It’s their 18th move in 50 years. They became Heritage residents in March.
As Pam says, “We are very well taken care of here.”

Pam and Bob can be found in 303P.

## Taj Lake Palace Hotel Udaipur, India
Martha Nell Beatty
Imagine a a gorgeous white marble palace. Then place that palace in the middle of a lake. That palace is now a hotel--the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur. I had a sense of adventure as I boarded the boat and a sense of awe as we slowly approached the palace. During my stay I kept feeling that I in a very special place
As a travel consultant, I had clients traveling to India the following year. With great enthusiasm, I told them of my experience staying in the enchanting hotel and said that really they needed to add it to their itinerary. They agreed. Their report: because of a draught, the lake had dried up and they had to be driven on a dry lakebed to the hotel. Being good travelers, they didn’t complain.

## The Mughal Empire
Br Dr Doris Howard

The Mughal empire began in 1526 when a descendant of Genghis Khan, Babur, was invited by Indian princes to Delhi to advise them about their local dissidents. He advised them by running them out and establishing his own empire of Turkish and Persian people. They gradually assumed control over the Indian subcontinent. Mughal is the Persian word for Mongol. (Interesting linguistic extrapolations occur when people move around the world.) The Mughals' power expanded and peaked about 1600. The Mughals were Muslim. However, they ruled equitably, permitting no conflict between Muslims and Hindus. They were known for their art, competent governing and architecture, including the Taj Mahal and great palaces in Delhi, Agra and Lahore. They became very wealthy, economically and culturally.
At its height, the Mughals cpntrolled India from the Indus River Basin in the East to present-day Afghanistan in the North and Kashmir in the West. They ruled from about 1500 to 1800 when other Indian dynasties challenged the Mughals. The Mughals were then reduced in size and strength. After 1800, they lived in and around Delhi until 1857 when the English deposed the last Mughal emperor after the Indian Rebellion.
The British (and the rest of Europe) had long known of the varius spices grown in the warmer climate of the East. Always the entrepreneurs, the English formed the British East India Company in 1757 to import spices from the East. The company co-existed with the Mughal princes. Together they controlled the spice trade and the weaker peoples of India. This led to great riches for the Mughals and also to the development of the greater British Empire upom which the sun never sets.
As the East India Company developed, the English settled in large numbers, both to run the various businesses and to keep the English Army supplied. Increasing numbers of English people absorbed increasing numbers of land grants from th Mughals. Britain ruled the Indian subcontinent, buying the complicity of the Mughals by supporting the Mughals' exploitation of others; making Britain and the Mughals rich and the rest of India poor.
The ndian Mutiny or Rebellion occurred in 1857-58, when impoverished Indians and Indian soldiers in the English army rebelled. Both groups suffered from racial bias, economic deprivation and reduced living conditions for the Indian soldiers. By the time the English put down the mutiny, they had acquired domination of the Mughals and all of India. The English government took over the East India Company which had become corrupt in their business by now. The governing of India was now in the hands of Parliament in London. This was called the Crown or Direct Rule. The period of the British Raj followed.
Yje term referred to the almost total control by the English. However, the collaboration btween the Mughals and English remained. With less need to govern, the Mughal families devoted themselves to lives of luxury. A few years ago, there was an exhibit of Mughal riches at the Legion of Honor Museum. In the period between 1858 and 1940, the Mughals apparently devoted themselves to clothing and jewelry. The exhibit showed photographs of splendidly dressed beautiful men and women in sweeping garments, The jewels on dispay were swords, rings, bracelets, and necklaces made of an excess of exquisite gems.
Despite their riches, the Mughals and most of the Indian people were not happy with the Brtish Raj. Mughals lived comfortably bur had no say in government. English people lived comfortably under British rule, filling numerous jobs. Other Indians lived less comfortably. They all lived through WWII but, soon after, India was split up in smaller countries. The Hindus run India now and the great Mughals are history.

## Ask Not: The Kennedys and the Women They Destroyed

(Non Fiction - Biography) by Maureen Callahan 2024

This book reveals the terrible and sometimes deadly treatment of women who dare to connect with some Kennedy men. Do all Kennedy men have high regards for the women in their lives? This book says “no” they do not. Several of the stories in Ask Not are difficult to read and are difficult to realize they actually happened to wives, mistresses, babysitters, secretaries and more.
I think the chapter that had the most impact on me was the one in which the author described Ted Kennedy’s car accident on Chappaquiddick in 1969. Did you know Mary Jo Kopechne (28) lived for nearly one hour in the car as it sat upside-down in the pond?
To say this book is a compelling read is a huge understatement!

## Duck Season Journal: Chapter 2
by Bob Granucci

Plenty of Nothing
I asked Harlan whether there were any ducks on the property. “Bob, you don’t want to know.” Siena and I took a short walk, saw no ducks, then joined others in the club room to watch the sixth game of the World Series. The Giants lost.
At least Jim had brought mallards from his hunt in Canada which Frank barbecued and Abe served with wild rice and orange sauce.
The following morning — borrowing from Raymond Chandler — stillness covered the marsh like a sheet in the morgue. Marc and I slept in, ate breakfast, then took Siena to the division line gate where she ran freely, jumping in and out of the river, enjoying her time far more than keeping still in a blind.
Richard bagged a spoonie, the least desirable duck, and that was it. A song ran through my mind, George Gershwin's “I've Got Plenty of Nothing,” from Porgy and Bess. The Club's new theme song?
Wonders Never Cease
Marc and I weren’t expecting much from our 2pm crossing. The afternoon was clear with a light haze and soft wind from the west. At the harbor we met the usual suspects: Mike, Frank, Jim, Richard, and Harlan who’d changed his tune from before: There were a few ducks on the property. I spotted a dozen or so around the resting ponds, near blind #1.
Bob, in your journal, we move from blind #1 to dinner that evening. Can you add a sentence or two here so readers know you didn’t catch anything that day?
At 4am, walking out to give Siena her wake-up cookie, the full moon was setting in the west with a breath of wind from the east. Hardly promising conditions.
I had first pick and invited Mike to join me at blind #12. My motor was still with the mechanic so we went out in his boat. I took the inner island and Siena immediately settled when I spread my flotation coat next to the barrel.
Shortly after dawn, a spoonie passed within range. I fired a shot and missed but was not displeased. Half an hour later, a pair of gadwall passed overhead at 25 yards. I focused on the first one, pressed the trigger, and was delighted to see it tumble into the pond about 15 yards away.
Siena hesitated but after repeated coaxing, she took a few steps into the water and enthusiastically went out, picking up the bird, bringing it to hand.
This was my first duck in over two years and I couldn’t have been more pleased.
