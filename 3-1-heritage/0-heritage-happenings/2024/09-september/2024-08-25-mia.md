Please use items in this document - Heritage Happenings Calendar Regular Events - to update all the calendar events:

Things tp consider: If you drag a file shared with you to one of your own folders, you are dragging the file from a folder shared by another person to a folder owned by you.

I note that the file named "2024-09-happenings-calendar-08-25-0" (your file I renamed) is show in Microsoft Word File tab as residing in a folder owned by Mia Harlock.

My guess is that we are having trouble because a file owned me (or you) is being held in a folder own by you - which is making sharing tricky

Working with shared folders can be very tricky. If you drag something out of the folder, you drag it out for everybody.

My advice: Only open files to edit created by me. If you want a new file let me know.

More on all this when we speak,

Cheers,

Theo
