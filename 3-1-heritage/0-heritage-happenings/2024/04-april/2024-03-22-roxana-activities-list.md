# 2024-03-22 Roxana Events List

Hi Roxana,

Thank your for sending me the list of events for the April Heritage Happenings newsletter.

Is it possible to have more details about the events?

Items that could be included with the event are:

* Website link (preferably) or Instagram, linkedIn, or Facebook page
* If not available from one of the above: Photograph of the performer or speaker
* Brief descriptions of the activity.
  * Music performances, for example, could include the genre of music, the performer's background, and the pieces they will be playing.
  * Lectures could include the speaker's background and the topic they will be discussing.

Having access to this data will speed up and reduce errors on both Margaret's and my part.
