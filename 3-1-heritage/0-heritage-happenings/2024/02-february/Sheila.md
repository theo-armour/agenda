# Sheila in Taipei, Taiwan

The Around the World adventure is celebrating China this month. We asked Sheil to share thoughts about her visit to Taipei in 1966

I had just flown in to Taiwan & was looking for a cheap hotel. I was afraid they were full up, but no, they had plenty of empty rooms, in fact the hotel was nearly empty, I had a nice room for $5. I spent that first rainy afternoon writing a letter home:

Evergreen Hotel Sun Moon Lake Taiwan

July 6, 1966

Dear Family:

Well, here I am in the Republic of China! How exciting that sounds.

I'm sitting here in a very nice lakeside hotel looking at a gorgeous view, miles from anywhere - but it's raining very hard and the mist is creeping over the mountains and it's very lovely. This island is absolutely beautiful!!! It reminds me of Robinson Crusoe Land. It's covered with green mountains and banana plantations and rice fields. And here the farmers do wear the conical shaped straw hats like this:

and use water buffalo to pull their ploughs in the rice fields.

I landed in Taipei, the capital, on Saturday and brother, what a lousy town! I think I have been so spoiled by Japan that I was disappointed because of that. For one thing, it's so hot and humid that the people all wear poor looking clothes. Taipei didn't show me a thing in fact I disliked it so much I made a plane reservation to leave Monday but that was before I left the capital. Since then I have been very happy. The scenery is superb. First of all I caught an express train right down the western side of the island to Kaohsiung which is the largest industrial city and a big Chinese naval base. Fortunately I didn't see the industrial part I kept in the suburbs and went by local buses to two beautiful lakes that have colorful pagodas, towers and temples scattered about. A Chinese navy officer took me under his wing and showed me the second lake. It's surprising how many people speak a little english. Next I caught a train to Tainan, which is the oldest city of Taiwan and saw the remains of the Dutch rule here. They were driven out in 1661 by Koxinga, the national hero, and I visited a shrine in his honor.

The streets everywhere here are so crowded, and there are food stalls everywhere taking up most of the roadway, and with them and the crowds a car can only get through very slowly, honking his horn all the time. Most of the poplace seems to eat at these food stalls. The food to me looks ugly and flybitten, not at all like the stalls in Japan.

The pedicabs here are very colorful

in Egypt too:

Dad, you probably saw them

The drivers usually are naked except for shorts and hat. I always ask "How much?", and they say "TW $10", and then I offer "TW $5", etc. etc. I'm sure I pay more than I should, but I don't mind, TW $5 is only 124, and they work hard. This morning I was rushing to catch a train and I promised double if he sped, and poor man, every time he slackened I would prod him in the back and wave my TW $10 bill, but I caught the train.

Last night I had dinner in a de luxe class hotel and felt very luxurious all for $1 ! Food here is cheap. I had steak for lunch on the train, and it was only 624. The express trains are very clean, with western style toilet, and they serve free glasses of green tea.

China is nothing near as clean as Japan, however. For instance, in Japan I would eat anything anywhere, but here I would not reat from a street stall. I love chinese food, but I eat western style food when alone because it is so much cheaper. A group of people is needed to eat chinese dishes at a reasonable cost.

I just bought a bottle of chinese rice wine. Ugh! I don't like it. It tastes like smokey sherry, but not pleasant. There was a hotel fire in Taipei and four American servicemen burned to death. Taipei is a G.I. town. They go there on R & R ("Rest and Recuperation") from Vietnam. They buy a girl for five days at $20 a day; she gets half and the bar gets half.

Last night in Tainan there were also a lot of american G.I.'s, but I met a civilian who is on contract with China Airlines, and he took me to the base Officers' Club for drinks and then a couple of the girlie bars in town. I got a cheap hotel $3.75 and the bed was round.

My hotel in Taipei was so dirty. There was a tide mark of thick dust everywhere except at the edge of the bed and closet, and the bathroom! However, it was airconditioned and cheap and with a private bathroom. I'm willing to put up with discomfort to save expense I am not complain- ing, just telling you for your interest. I love this travelling I am very happy.

The beds are western style, and so are toilets in China. Also, strangely enough, they wear the same wedding dresses we do. here have very nice figures and wear chinese style dresses The girls very attractive.

I saw an old lady this morning in Tainan who had had her feet bound when she was a baby. She was hobbling along. She was relatively tall, but her feet were the size of a child's. Poor lady. That was a cruel thing in those days, because she today can hardly walk.

The rain has stopped and the scenery is beautiful. and lake water are both green, with a steam like white mist. The mountains Everyone has been telling me I will enjoy Hong Kong, and I am looking forward to it. Maybe I will try and get a job there.

A Japanese man mailed me a letter to your address; please forward it to me. I would like to get a letter from you telling me your news, and how the house is progressing. I should arrive in Hong Kong around the

last week in July, give or take a week. I think I will shower now, and

change for dinner.

Bye now, lots a love,

Sheila-
