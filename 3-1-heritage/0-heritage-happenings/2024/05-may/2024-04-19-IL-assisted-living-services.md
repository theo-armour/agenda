## Introduction

Don't ask too many questions at once.

## First round of questions

What are some typical examples of services that are offered at each level of care for Private Pay Assisted Living residents? Do the fees for private pay assisted living services include room and board? If not, what is the cost of room and board for private pay assisted living residents?

What are some typical examples of Continuing Care Assisted Living (AL) services that are offered at each level of care for IL residents? Do these include things like personal laundry, making beds daily, wake up calls and so on?

Are there currently any Independent Living (IL) residents who are receiving Continuing Care Assisted Living (AL) services in their IL apartments? If so, how many?


## More questions

* Is there a fee schedule for things like personal laundry and making beds daily?
* What are the numbers of residents on Type A and Type C contracts
* Please explain the pricing differences between Private pay assisted living and continuing care assisted living.


## Type A

* Your rent - adjusted annually - includes all levels of care and services - including any fees that need to be paid to third parties such as skilled nursing or hospice care.
* When I hear about a meeting that reached no conclusion and I hear "it needs a lot more explaining", I do not feel good about it.
* Type A should have a meeting and draft a letter with specific questions what what they would like to know about the contract.
