## Tucker ~ Octoberfest -

I was running as fast as I could, but that German waiter was still after me. My one Liter Hofbrau mug still in hand. He was probably twice my age, it was Octoberfest, and he was only doing his job, trying to catch a 21-year old skinny American wiseguy. My college roommate had been directed to a table with four beefy middle-aged Munchenites, all of whom with spoke American vernacular lingo with ease because, as they told us cheerily, they had been sent as POWs to Texas. They loved us. So the question looms embarrassingly, why on God's green earth do we so often attack such good beer-drinking neighbors?

Will and Ariel Durant, after 35 years of recording much of world history, write that the perennial answer will always be a combinationof pride, acquisitiveness, and pugnacity.

The waiter behind me exemplified those attributes of hostility: He was proud of his job, acquisitive of the beer stern, and ready to be pugnacious. But then, so was I, proud, acquisitive,and insultingly pugnacious by my theft. The waiter would be mollified if I surrendered the mug, but he was by now on his way back to his job, and I was left with feeling society's collective guilt and dismay, beer stein or not. And perhaps we should, some of us anyway, really be ashamed of ourselves. Sometimes.

The Berlin Wall In 1988

I revisited Berlin in 2011. By 2011 all of Germany had been reunified, but during the Cold War, Germany and Berlin had been divided between the Communist East and the "free" West. About 1988 while the Russians ruled East Berlin, I passed from West Berlin by myself, on foot, via Checkpoint Charlie. I had to pay a visa fee, and was given $8 in East German marks and was allowed to spend four hours or so in Russian East Berlin. So in 1988 I crossed the border on foot, with my $8 East German marks, which was just enough to pay for dinner there, then I returned to West Berlin again through Checkpoint Charlie.

Photo 1: Photo of Checkpoint Charlie as it is today. It is now kept as a tourist attraction, and visitors pay a tip to have their photo taken at the Checkpoint.

Photo 2: Photo of a portion of the Berlin Wall erected by the
Russians 1961-1989 to seal off the Russian Sector, so that Eastern Berliners could not escape to West Berlin. This graffiti was painted on the Western side.

Photo 3: Another remnant of the Berlin Wall when I visited Berlin again in 2011. Germany has been reunified for so long now that there is extremely little of the old Wall left, and is used as a tourist attraction.

Photo 4: Me at the Holocaust Memorial near the famous Brandenburg Gate, representing the victims killed by Nazi Hitler.
