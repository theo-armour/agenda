Musings Of A Crypto Conservative

What's really comfortable about life here at the Julia Morgan sanctuary is the equanimity of the place. we, all of us, have done well enough to enjoy the pleasure of each other's company, in no small way a financial achievement resulting from diligence and moderation. No arguing at the table, no gossipy rumors, no rancor.

How's this possible? in our city so bristling with problems?

Maybe the answer is connected to our collective philosophical wisdom, otherwise labeled, religious foundation.

The famed Sermon on the Mount has a somewhat puzzling the beatitude which catches one attention, "Blessed are they who thirst for the righteousness, for they shall be satisfied". The effort of the San Francisco Supervisors, as feeble in results as always, attempt righteousness. And we here at the Morgan home appreciate their efforts as being sincere, knowing full well that there's absolutely no reason to argue about it .

Homelessness? Poverty? Crime? Drugs? C'est la vie, c'est la guerre, lus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. n'est-ce pas?

So we keep calm and carry on.
