Residents’ Families: Rancheros in Gold Rush California

By Martha Nell Beatty

As we all know, in 1853 in San Francisco Ladies’ Protection and Relief Society began taking care of women and children who were seeking food and shelter.
It was also in 1853 that Patsy Hulting’s ancestors began an eight-month journey by foot and horseback from Illinois to California driving 2,400 sheep. These men were cousins, Dr Thomas Flint and Llewellyn Bixby, who formed the firm of Flint, Bixby & Co in 1865.This was the men’s second trip, for they had previously traveled to California round trip by ship. On that earlier trip, they had spent a year and a half in the mining town of Volcano.
In the summer of 1855, they bought Rancho San Justo outside of San Juan Bautista from Francisco Perez Pacheco They then proceeded to sell half of the rancho to their friend Colonel Hollister. The rancho remained their headquarters for the next 40 years. Sarah Bixby Smith wrote about the ranch’s location her book Adobe Days, “The vast stretches of open valley and hill land were practically uninhabited and were infested with wild beasts and sometimes even wild men.”
The firm entered the southern part of the state in 1866 with the purchase of Rancho Los Cerritos. Later they acquired interest in Rancho Los Alamitos, Rancho Palos Verdes and the Southern Rancho San Joaquin, which they later sold to James Irvine.
As if raising sheep wasn’t enough, they operated the Coast Line Stage Co carrying mail and passengers from San Francisco to Southern California. And then started manufacturing sugar from beets. The firm was dissolved in 1896 with the death of Llewellyn Bixby.
And Anne Morris’ ancestors entered the scene in the first month of 1850, Anne Morris’ great grandfather Richard O’Neill and his buddy James Flood came to San Francisco from New Brunswick, Canada. Flood opened a saloon and O’Neill opened a butcher shop. After Flood struck it big in silver mining, he bought a ranch in the San Joaquin Valley and asked O’Neill to run it. Thirty years later Flood heard Pio Pico had gone broke and had to sell Rancho Santa Marguerite property in South Orange County. The men formed a partnership on a handshake and went on to purchase the 250,000-acre ranch. O’Neill ran the ranch while Flood stayed in San Francisco. Anne’s father John Baumgartner and his brother Jerome grew up there—until it was time to go to grammar school in San Francisco.
When World War II came along, the ranch was taken by the government in an act of eminent domain. The southern part of the property became Camp Pendleton, a Marie Corps base.
With that property gone, Baumgartner went in search for ranch land to purchase. He found a place he bought near Hollister (nothing like Santa Margarita), Baumgartner lived there until he met Anne’s mother Elinor and moved to San Juan. Later they moved to Hollister, where Anne and her brother Peter grew up. When he began thinking about their Golden Years, Baumgartner bought a property outside San Juan Bautista where he and his wife could be happy. The present ranch is run by Anne’s son Joe and is very close to Patsy’s ancestors’ original ranch. That property is now St Francis Retreat owned by the Franciscans.
Patsy’s and Anne’s families were truly California Pioneers. Alas, they could not become part of the Society of California Pioneers, which had the strict requirement that the members had to have come before 1850. However, Anne is a member due to her
now great grandfather on her mother’s side Jacob Lermen, who came around The Horn in 1848. The same year, her great grandmother at 15 crossed the Isthmus of Panama on a mule. She came to San Francisco, where she lived and raised her family on Telegraph Hill.

## SF GAS LIGHT CO Building ~ Buchanan and Fort Point St
By Fred Wentker

Many visitors wonder about the history of this unusual and attractive brick building, seeming out of style with the modern apartments now surrounding it.

The San Francisco Gas Company was a very early San Francisco business, founded in 1850 by one of the earliest pioneers, Peter Donahue, an immigrant from Ireland. He immediately sensed that the fast growing city would need gas for lighting. He and his two brothers also founded what became Union Iron Works, and other early businesses. The gas works was located near Market Street but in 1873 moved to what became know as Gas Light Cove.

It is difficult to visualize the area now because the Cove was much larger and the water came within a few feet of Fort Point Street.

The operation required anthracite (hard) coal, which had to be processed to release the gas in the coal. But the nearest anthracite came from Australia, and later from England. A major improvement a few years later was the forcing of water into the coal which then released more gas.

Joseph B Crockett, Jr became president in 1885 and 1891 built the brick building which still stands. There were various purchases of competitors over the years and the company was sold to PG&E in 1905. They had a very large gas storage tank next to the office and the tank was destroyed in the 1906 fire. A much smaller tank survived, and I recall seeing it when we arrived in early 1961. PG&E used the office space for a while but sold it for $100,000 to a decorator, who operated their business for 15 years then sold it to various real estate brokers. The building is not occupied now.

A booklet with a short text and several photos and diagrams was published in 2011 and is in our library - “A Place of Light and Power” by Gray Brechin.

I recommend a short internet article from 2020, “SF Gas Light Building, Oct 13, 2020” by Woody La Bounty. There are more recent photos including one of a new apartment building at the rear (Buchanan Street side) of the current building. I found but have lost a 2023 internet report that the City has given final approval of the new construction, but it will take 2 more years before construction can begin.


## Jackie ~ Public, Private, Secret By J Randy Taraborrelli
Review by Trish Otstott

Based on hundreds of interviews with friends, family, and lovers over a thirty-year period—as well as previously unreleased material from the JFK Library, Kennedy historian J Randy Taraborrelli paints an unforgettable new portrait of Jacqueline Kennedy Onasis.
This book reveals very personal aspects of this iconic former first lady. I was surprised to learn Jackie was a lifetime smoker of L&M cigarettes. I was surprised to learn that her relationship with her sister, Lee Radizwill, was rocky at best.
I was saddened all over again, by the chapters describing the fatal campaign trip to Dallas. I was impressed all over again, by the public display of her personal dignity at such a tragic time in her life.
This book was an excellent read. I think we all have wondered about Jackie and her life after JFK and this book tells it all. Everything.
Jackie can be found in the Stucky Library.

## Homes – Rooms – I have made/known/loved/tolerated

Just as a remembrance for you all, I thought I might make a memoir of the places in which I have lived and sometimes been the creator of.

It was while sitting in my former living room at 550 Battery that I began to think about the other rooms I had liked, been comfortable in, sometimes loved, sometimes endured. The Baatery Street living room was a pretty good one. I think I made it about as much of it as I coul. The view of the old Custom House across the street made the room more than its white box presence would promise. And the bay laurel in front of the Custom House was an unexpected pleasure, especially when the wind blew. The street life out my windows was another pleasure - always something going on, people moving about on some business or other; skateboarders, families out for a walk, dot-commers going north, financial workers going south, coffee cups, iPads, mobiles in hand, sometimes small dramas playing out. I thought was going to be the last room in the long line of places – but who knew that I would move to Heritage on the Marina?

BRIDGETON
The first place I ever rented on my own was ‘way back in 1942, the year I graduated from George School. Living at home with my father and his wife was not going to be possible, so, with my father’s help I got my first job: telephone operator with Ma Bell in Bridgeton, about 30 miles from Salem. I rented a room in the home of an elderly woman, lonely like me. I shared her kitchen and we became good friends over the year or so I was there. She gave me the courage to defy my father and go to New York to visit a friend from George School. That was the weekend I met Duncan, a first-year student at Columbia.

But the room…. It was an old fashioned small town house; my closet was under the eaves and, in that cold winter I would put the alarm clock in the closet, forcing me to get out of bed in the morning to turn it off. I still hate getting out of bed on a cold morning, even though (maybe because) I grew up in a cold house.

The pay at Ma Bell then started at $14 a week, but overtime was a constant and brought it closer to $20. However, living was so cheap that I put $3 a week in the bank. The company had all one’s time: we worked what they called “split tricks” – four hours in the morning, three hours off, and then four more hours after that. That kept us pretty well chained to the job. There isn’t much you can do in a small town where you know no one but wash the car, go to a movie, read a book. They wanted to move me up to Long Distance, but I decided to get out when it became clear that the telephone company was going to become an "essential service" to the war effort, from which I would be unable to extricate myself for the “duration".
