# 2024-06-25 Bob C Chronic Add

I was pleased to see the heritage on the Marina ad in the Chronicle Senior Living section the other day.

Here's some observations

The ad says "SERVING SAN FRANCISCO FOR 100 YEARS"

As far as I know :
* The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief society has been in operation since August 4 1853.
* The Morgan building will be 100 years old next year.

The text of the entire advertisement is in all caps.
Text in all caps is generally more difficult to read compared to mixed-case text. This conclusion is supported by several studies and expert opinions in the field of typography and cognitive science. References upon request.

The ad offers two phone numbers

Yet a single phone number is easier for customers to remember and less likely to cause confusion. This can be particularly important in advertisements where space and attention are limited. It reduces the cognitive load on the customer, making it more likely they will take action and contact you.

RCFE Number
The advertisement provides an RSCFE number but does not explain what it is And what aging in place is all about. If I understand things correctly comma. heritage on arena is one of the few organizations that offers multiple levels of care In a single establishment in the city.
