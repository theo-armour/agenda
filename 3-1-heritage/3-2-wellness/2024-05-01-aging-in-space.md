Space Medicine

* Aging accelerates significantly ~ 30x faster
* Twin brothers: Scott Kelly (astronaut) and Mark Kelly (retired astronaut)
* Mark recovered
* nature to publish 50 articles next month ~ so why not wait until published for this talk?
* Good place for studies
* Use Organoids
* rotators turn as same speed as cells fall = micro-gravity
* microgravity: see accelerated aging 24 hours rotate = 5 years aging
* cell skeleton degrades
* space travel ~ radiation is the biggest problem
* need DNa response
* organoids offer possibility of individualized - precision medicine
* organoids dervived from blood cells ~ luxury medicine
* would more gravity help slow aging? Not likely
* Immune dysfunction causes aging - increased activation
* chronic inflammation
* any new environment will cause inflammation
* plastics: bad
* exposome: all exposures
* plasticizers: bad for health
* leaching like hormones
* nano plastics cross barriers
* _The Graduate_ - plastics are the future
* Eradicate plastics by 2040 INC5
* No good markers for inflammation
* Iage ~ inflammation age
* Healthy cellfie coming ~ will be free
* Hasn't tests himself ~ regulations prevent
* pricy organoids in 2027
