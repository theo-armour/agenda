## Project Description:
The proposed "Project" Heritage on the Marina is a life care retirement community located in the Marina District of San Francisco. The community is comprised of a historic and iconic building designed by Julia Morgan in 1925, the Perry Building built in 1957, and the Health Center (skilled nursing facility) built in 1963. The challenge is to develop and implement a plan of additions and renovations that will build on the historical reputation and architectural attributes of the community. While the area of the building will be increased in the proposed plans to allow for an expanded number of care suites, the overall height and uses will remain the same. Improvements to the Morgan building facades will be purely restorative while, in thoughtful contrast, the proposed new architecture will be both compatible and current.
