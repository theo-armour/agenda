Why is one number better?

Having one emergency number can be beneficial because it simplifies the process of reaching emergency services. When there is only one number to remember, it is easier for people to quickly access help in an emergency situation. Additionally, having a single emergency number can help to streamline the response process, as all emergency calls are routed through a central location. This can help to ensure that emergency services are dispatched quickly and efficiently. However, it is important to note that having multiple emergency contacts can also be helpful in case your primary contact cannot be reached. Is there anything else you would like to know?
