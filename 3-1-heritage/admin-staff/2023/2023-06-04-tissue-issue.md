Subject: Request for Clear Communication on Housekeeping Supplies

We are writing to bring to your attention an issue regarding the communication and consistency surrounding the supply of housekeeping supplies in our apartments.

Over the past week, numerous residents have received conflicting information from the housekeeping staff during apartment cleanings. Some residents were informed that Heritage would no longer provide toilet paper, while others were told that there would be a limit of one roll per week. Additionally, some residents were not informed of any changes to the supply of housekeeping supplies at all.

These inconsistencies have led to confusion and rumors spreading throughout the campus. It is crucial that Heritage provides clear and consistent information to all residents regarding the availability of housekeeping supplies, including toilet paper, tissues, paper towels, and hand soap.

Furthermore, when there are changes or updates in the policies related to housekeeping supplies, we kindly request that the management team ensures advance notice is given to the residents. This will allow us to plan accordingly and alleviate any unnecessary stress or anxiety that may arise from sudden changes.
Additionally, considering the diverse linguistic backgrounds of our housekeeping staff, it is essential to communicate any updates directly to residents, ensuring effective understanding and minimizing the chance of miscommunication.

We believe that by implementing these measures, Heritage can foster a transparent and supportive environment that prioritizes the well-being and peace of mind of its residents. Clarity and consistency in communication will go a long way in maintaining a positive living experience for all.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to hearing from you and receiving updates on the steps taken to address these concerns regarding housekeeping supplies.
