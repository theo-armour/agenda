Hello people who might know

I am in the midst of crafting Wikipedia articles for Heritage on the Marina and San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.  The articles will also have references to Crocker Old People's Home, Scandinavian Benevolent and Relief Society, Julia Morgan, Mary Taupe, the three portraits that hang in the stairs, notable benefactors and residents and more.

In order to craft a well-formed Wikipedia article, all content must cite authoritative sources. I have access to many good sources but three books will be the primary sources:

1. Beans, Rowena. 1953. _Inasmuch; the one-hundred year history of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, 1853-1953_. Edited by Carol Green Wilson. James J. Gillick and Co, San Francisco
2. Wilson, Carol Green, 1970, _San Francisco Ladies' Protection and Relief Society_, San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, San Francisco
3. Chase, Ashley, 2003, _Our Heritage : the San Francisco Ladies' Protection and Relief Society : 1853-2003, the first 150 years_, San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, San Francisco

I currently have access to book #2, Carol Wilson's book, but even with a good look around the Stucky Library, I cannot locate Bean's or Chase's works.

Having access to either or both will much reduce the time I must spend at San Francisco Public Library - where both books are available but not loaned out. If during you wanderings around the premises you have happened to come across either of these two books, kindly let me know where they are.

If you would like to help or to look at the current draft, or if you have any good thoughts or possible references, please also let me know.
