I am friendly and easy to talk to.

All of you know me and who I am. 

I know all of you by name and and where you live and more.

But there is more to me than that.

Over the last 50 years have served on seven boards of directors in three countries 

As editor of Heritage Happenings, I am very familiar with how this place operates. 

As a an architect I am familiar with the issues of maintaining a campus

I will sign the NDA and comply with all Board guidelines.

Yet my instinct is for openness. 

My door — both literal and metaphorical — remains open. 

Unless I am sleeping or napping my apartment door is open.

I welcome your questions and ideas at any time. 

I will brief you on Board matters once they have been appropriately discussed internally, 

Representing you means bringing every perspective to the table.


## Third: My Platform

What will I do as a member of the board of directors?

I will Use my architectural background to shape the Strategic Plan and the ensure the Julia Morgan Building in remains good shape.

I will use my computer and technical background to help with the information technology issues and communications issues.

Finally, I will use my heart and soul to ensure the Society continues to offer protection and relief to every resident — today and into the future.
