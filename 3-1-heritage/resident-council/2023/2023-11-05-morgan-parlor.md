Compiled by Theo Armour

## Preface

A design brief outlines the deliverables and scope of the project including function and aesthetics. This design brief covers a refit of the Heritage on the Marina Morgan Parlor. It is a work in progress.

## Introduction

The Morgan Parlor is a large space on the ground floor of the Heritage on the Marina. It is used for many different activities. It is a large room with a fireplace, a grand piano. It is used for many different activities. It is used for informal meetings, games, watching performances, reading, cocktail parties, and is the site of the annual Christmas Tree.

The mission statements for the Morgan Parlor:

-   Accommodates a variety of uses and activities
-   Feels like home to residents
-   Is easy to maintain and keep clean
-   Is accessible to residents with mobility issues
-   Is easy to move furniture around
-   In keeping with the design of the Julia Morgan building

With the holiday season approaching, the intent should be to have the Morgan Parlor ready for the holiday season.

## Uses and Activities

The Morgan Parlor is used for many different activities:

-   **Informal meetings**: residents and staff use the Morgan Parlor for informal meetings and quiet conversation.
-   **Games**: Residents play games such as mahjong, scrabble and bridge. These usually require bridge tables with four chairs each
-   **Watching performances**. Musicians often perform in the Morgan Parlor. generally, when there is a performance, Maintenance staff move the furniture to the side of the room and set up several dozen chairs facing the performers.
-   **Reading**: From time-to-time residents read books and magazines in the Morgan Parlor.
-   **Cocktail parties**: Several time as year there are events such as memorial services and cocktail parties. These events require a large number of chairs and tables as most of the attendees prefer to sit than stand
-   **Christmas Tree**. Every year, a Christmas Tree is set up in the Morgan Parlor. This requires a large amount of space, including worktables to spread out the decorations.

## Circulation

-   Many residents have mobility issues. They use walkers and wheelchairs. They need space to move around the room. They need to be able to move from the door to the elevator and to the restrooms.
-   Residents are very accommodating. They are willing to move chairs and tables to make room for other residents. But, they need furniture that is easy to move.

## Seating Considerations

-   Chairs that can be moved easily by a single resident
-   Chairs with arms are easier to move than chairs without arms
-   A seat height of 19" is easier for residents to get in and out of
-   Armrests should be at a height where the arms can rest comfortably
-   Armrests aid in the process of sitting down and standing up
-   Backrests should provide adequate lumbar support
-   Adequate cushioning is important to prevent pressure sores and maintain comfort
-   The material should prevent sliding when sitting down or standing up
-   The Dining Room chairs are a good example of chairs that are easy to move, have a good height, and comfortable to sit in

## Tables

-   Games usually require bridge tables with four chairs each
-   Tables should be easy to move and easy to clean
-   Tables that may be abutted to form a larger table

## Lighting and Power Points

-   Light switches should be easy to spot, to reach and easy to use
-   Power points for laptops and charging phones ditto

## Style

Residents are likely to enjoy:

-   Rich wood tones with classic detailing
-   Traditional patterns like florals, plaids, and stripes in upholstery and window treatments.
-   Comfortable, plush seating with accessible support for sitting and standing. Classic color palettes, often favoring warmer tones for a cozy and inviting atmosphere.

## Stylistic Examples

## Other Considerations

-   Marketing to new residents. What do they want?
-   Maintenance & housekeeping. What is easy to maintain and keep clean?

## What do we want?

-   Better and deeper research process on resident needs and wants
-   Concepts (drawings or images) shared with residents prior to implementation
-   Testing and trying out concepts with actual furniture samples
-   A process for evaluating the success of the design
