# 2023-11-06 Morgan Parlor Reply

Hi Mary

Thank you for your reply regarding the Ambiance Committee and the 2024 capital budget.

The reason why I added the "Morgan Parlor Furniture" item to the October Residents Council Agenda, and Margaret Jacobs drafted her "Letter to AdministraTion" signed by many and I drafted the "Morgan Parlor Design Brief" is because nothing documented or actionable let alone completed has come out of the Ambiance Committee meetings.

Unless the Christmas Tree is placed elsewhere, the current layout of the Morgan Parlor will impede the decoration of the Christmas Tree and its later use as a photo backdrop and will impede the use of the Morgan Parlor for the Christmas Party.

Tree Decoration starts early in December and should be complete by the date of the Christmas Party. With Thanksgiving coming up in a few weeks, it seems to me that the time to schedule and act on a quick "retrofit" is now.
