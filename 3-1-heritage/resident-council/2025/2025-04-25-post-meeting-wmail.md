Hello Residents

My observations regarding the meeting of the Resident Council on April 25, 2025.

Michelle's comments about me this morning made me smile. her words were something like, "Theo is a cheerleader for Mary."

And her words are quite true. And I'm also a cheerleader for Archie, the new maintenance man, and Carl, who works in the garden on Thursdays, and Leonore, who is so good at housekeeping, the people that play baseball in Moscone Park and may others as well. It seems to me that people who are caring and trying their best can always benefit from cheerleaders. I certainly appreciated Doris for nominating me to the Board of Directors.

Anyway, Jeannee Parker Martin of Leading Age made a very good observation in response to Shirley's question regarding whether LeadingAge becomes involved in disputes between different groups.

Jeannee responded that they did so only on rare occasions. She said something like "LeadingAge avoids getting involved in day-to-day situations." 

Shirley and others have raised this question because there are instances where day-to-day situations at Heritage on the Marina are not being addressed by leadership to the satisfaction of the residents. Therefore residents are seeking to go to a higher level. This is absolutely understandable.

I have served on six boards of directors in three countries. I very much agree that when you're on a board, you want to avoid the day-to-day. Boards really want to concentrate on high-level strategic thoughts, focusing on long-range goals and the big picture. This is absolutely understandable.

Thus, bringing day-to-day issues to the attention of people who are being called upon to be decide long-term strategy inevitably results in conflict and disruption.

Off the top of my head, I can think of a possible response that might help. 

May I suggest and recommend that a subcommittee of the Board of Directors of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society be formed with the assignment of adjudicating leadership and resident day-to-day issues. This subcommittee would be composed of three or four members of the board and three or four residents.

The mission of the subcommittee would be to gather and analyze current resident issues and build them into strategies that would be useful to propose to the Board and all the other interested parties. 

The vision would be that residents have a venue to have their issues heard that goes outside of day-to-day leadership. and that leadership and the board have a way of fine-tuning their strategies and goals based on the input of residents.

This subcommittee, unless otherwise agreed, would operate with full disclosure.
