Hi Mary

In preparation for the Centenary Celebration, a good idea is to get the premises to look as nice as possible.

Please have a look at the attached PDF â€” first created and sent out to Residents Council officers and the Maintenance Department in June 2034.

Of the three observations, only the table has been removed. (Sadly, they also took the chairs, so now there is nowhere to sit.)

The pools and door are both fast, easy and cheap fixes. Please help to expedite them. ;-)
