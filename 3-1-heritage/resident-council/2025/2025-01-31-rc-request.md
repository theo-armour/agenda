## Celebrating the Beauty of the Julia Morgan Building

On March 27, hundreds of people will be walking around the and through the Julia Morgan Building. Many efforts have been carried out in recent months to make the building more accessible and to highlight its beauty.

Unfortunately, the two empty and dilapidated fountains in the Courtyard are still an eyesore on the premises. I request that the fountains be repaired and filled with water by March 27 or some other fix be applied to make them less of an eyesore.

**Celebrating the Beauty of the Julia Morgan Building**

On March 27, hundreds of visitors will explore the Julia Morgan Building, appreciating its architectural elegance. In recent months, significant efforts have been made to enhance accessibility and showcase its beauty.

However, the two empty, dilapidated fountains in the courtyard remain an unfortunate blemish on the otherwise stunning surroundings. I urge that these fountains be repaired and filled with water by March 27 or that an alternative solution be implemented to improve their appearance.
