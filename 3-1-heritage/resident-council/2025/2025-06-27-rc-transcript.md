**AI Suggestion**
AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
1. The community’s non-negotiable values and concerns—such as property ownership, board composition, and resident security—have not been clearly defined, formally communicated to the board, or incorporated into official documents. There is an urgent need to clarify, document, and discuss these values before any affiliate is selected to ensure they are protected and understood by all stakeholders.
2. The process for submitting resident concerns remains inconsistent and unclear, leading to confusion between informal and formal channels. It is necessary to standardize and reinforce a formal written submission process to Margaret, ensure concerns are aggregated and addressed at leadership meetings, and communicate this process clearly to all residents.
3. The loss of social work support following the health center closure has not been addressed, leaving residents without essential services. There is a need to revisit the impact of this loss and actively explore options for restoring or replacing social work support for residents.
4. Compliance with liquor service regulations is at risk, as Roxana has not yet completed the required 20-hour course and it is unclear if all staff serving liquor are properly licensed. Immediate monitoring and verification are needed to ensure all legal requirements are met and to avoid potential legal liabilities.
5. The advocacy and privacy procedures for residents are not fully understood or consistently followed. There is a need to clarify the process for completing and submitting advocacy forms, formalize the listing of advocates in the resident directory, and communicate these procedures to all residents to ensure privacy and advocacy needs are met.
