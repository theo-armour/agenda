# 2025-04-28 Residents Council Disarray

## What to do?

* Ask Tony
* BoD election delayed until what date?
* Don't propose or advise until asked

Shirley does not want to sign the non-disclosure agreement. 
Perhaps she is right. 
I don't know. 
I have blindly said that, if elected, I would sign the non-disclosure agreement. 
But actually, I've never seen it. I've never read it. 
Maybe I wouldn't sign it either. 
Maybe you wouldn't sign it either. 
Without having seen the non-disclosure agreement, it's difficult to know whether one would sign it or not. 
Or should I just sign it and ignore it? 
In any case, I think it would be a good thing for me to be able to see whether it is a document I would like to sign or not. 
I would hope that all my other residents would feel the same way. 
I think we should all be able to have a look at the non-disclosure agreement. 
I don't like talking about signing an agreement I've never read.
