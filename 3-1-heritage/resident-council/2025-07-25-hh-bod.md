# HH + BoD

## Leadership

* I welcome the reports, verbal and written
* I very much appreciate the full written reports
* I like the freedom of in-person, zoom and skipping
* I have no issues with the current format
* I am more pleased when the meeting is an hour or less
* I see no good reason for a change


## BoD

Meeting

* While I was with Sherrill, Board voted me in
* First Meeting ~ very pleasant
* Familiar ~ Similar to Leadership ~ Randy in Charge ~ very clear agenda items ~ I felt right at home
* I voted for first time ~ quite a big issue ~ My guess is that Mary will let residents know at next Leadership Meeting
* Affiliation ~ very pleased ~ no surprises ~ All have very good reputations

Next Steps

* Resident Satisfaction Survey ~ would like help putting together the questions

## Heritage Happenings

* Delighted to hand any part or all over to anybody else
* Delighted to work with anybody who wants to organize meetings
* I write or edit Heritage Happenings in email, web page and printable formats
* Sending by email heritage-happenings-sf@gmail.com
* Some not getting emails. if you feel you are not getting: let's talk

Not Doing

* Creating a document in "magazine format"
* Spending time dealing with the Front Office
* Worrying about wasting paper
