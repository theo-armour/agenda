Hi Patrick

I'm having issues with getting the June issue of the newsletter out. So I may or may not make it to the Residents Council meeting.

Two things:

## Cottage Door Key

Please ask for a vote on residents getting reasonable access to the cottage.

Two alternatives

The cottage door lock is updated to be openable by the key that residents use to open all doors and gates

A key to the door is made available to any resident at a nominal fee

## Meeting Records

Please ask for a vote on the Residents Council meeting records being made available to all residents either digitally or in their mailboxes.

This incudes

* Residents Council meeting records
* Town Hall meeting records
* San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society meeting records
