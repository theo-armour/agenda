My alarm went off at 7:30. I threw back the sheets and blanket. And got up period. I took a shower Drive myself And got dressed. I put on my jeans, one leg at a time. And button my shirt and went down for breakfast I have bacon and eggs and a nice cup of hot coffee with cream and sugar. After breakfast, I put the dishes in the dishwasher Put on my hat and coat And went down to the garage And open the door and Got into my Ford and drove to work I got to the office just on time around 9:30. I waited for the elevator push the button for the 8th floor And got to my desk just as my boss was arriving. He stopped by my desk. It said. And asked me to come to his office. I sat at his desk. And he smiled and looked at me and said, Chuck, we're giving you a bonus. Your sales have been the best of anybody in the organization this month. And for the last few months

After work A bunch of us went to the baseball game. And of course, I had to buy everybody a drink to celebrate my Bonus And the fact that we won the game. I got home around 11:30. I took off my shoes and socks And put on my slippers. I went to the kitchen and got a glass of milk and a cookie. I went to bed and fell asleep right away. I had a great day.
