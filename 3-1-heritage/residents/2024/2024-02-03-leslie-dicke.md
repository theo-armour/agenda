Hi Leslie

Laundry
Bernie is asking me about laundry. I tell him that Heritage does all the personal laundry for Assisted Living residents and Independent Living residents who need help.

IIRC, Bernie is with the Type A Lifetime Care contract. So he should receive laundry service at no extra charge.

Meds
I tell Bernie that Heritage does all the meds for Assisted Living residents and Independent Living residents who need help.

Getting Around
Mina the nurse on duty today and yesterday was able to get Bernie to come down for breakfast both days. But that is because she know him and is a great nurse. It would be great if al the other nurses did the same.

Levels of Care
Heritage provides for different levels of care - depending on the resident's needs. In essence this means that the tasks such as the ones above are entered into the daily checklists for the staff to do. This ensures that agency staff are made aware of the resident's needs.

 A good person to talk to about setting this up would be the new Director of Nursing, Martha Nkhoma, mnkhoma@heritagesf.org

Leslie. with all this, I hope I am not butting in. I just want to help ensure that Bernie is getting the care he needs to be comfortable and to be engaged with al of us here. Please do set limits on my involvement if you feel I am overstepping.
