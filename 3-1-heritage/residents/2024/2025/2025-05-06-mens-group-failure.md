Well now, pull up a chair, sonny. In my eighty years, I've seen a thing or two, and let me tell you, failure's been a mighty fine teacher. The biggest thing it hammered home for me? Resilience. Plain and simple. You get knocked down, you gotta find the gumption to get back up. Here are a few other nuggets I gleaned along the way:

* **It ain't the end of the road:** A setback feels monumental at the time, but looking back, it's usually just a bend.
* **Don't be afraid to pivot:** Sometimes your initial plan just ain't gonna work. Being stubborn won't help; being flexible will.
* **Listen to the whispers:** Often, there were little signs things weren't going right, but I was too bullheaded to notice.
* **Humility is a virtue:** Failure has a funny way of knocking the wind out of your sails and reminding you that you don't know it all.
* **Folks show their true colors:** You learn who your real friends are when the chips are down.
* **There's always a lesson to be learned:** Even in the biggest mess, you can usually find a valuable takeaway if you look hard enough.
* **Perfection is a myth:** Chasing an unattainable ideal can set you up for disappointment. Progress, not perfection, is the goal.
* **Don't dwell on "what ifs":** Hindsight is 20/20, but beating yourself up over past mistakes is a fool's errand.
* **Celebrate the small victories:** After a big stumble, the little steps forward feel like giant leaps. Appreciate them.
* **Tomorrow is another day:** As my dear old mother used to say, the sun will come up tomorrow. Don't let one bad day spoil all the good ones.

As an 80-year-old, reflecting on failures can bring profound lessons. Here's a list of what I’ve learned:

1. **Failure is a part of growth** – It’s never the end; it’s simply a stepping stone to something better. Each setback was a necessary lesson.

2. **Humility** – No matter how much I thought I knew, I learned that life humbles you. Failure teaches you to listen and accept your limits.

3. **Resilience is key** – You don’t always bounce back immediately, but with patience and persistence, you find a way to get up and keep moving.

4. **Adapting is essential** – When things don’t go as planned, adapting to new circumstances becomes the greatest tool for overcoming obstacles.

5. **Don’t take it personally** – Failure isn’t a reflection of your worth. It’s just part of the process. Your value is inherent, and mistakes don’t define it.

6. **You can’t control everything** – I used to try to control outcomes, but I’ve learned that many factors are out of your hands. Embrace uncertainty and move forward.

7. **The importance of support** – I couldn’t have gotten through some of my toughest times without the encouragement of friends, family, and even mentors. Don't isolate yourself.

8. **Take responsibility** – It's easy to blame others, but taking responsibility for my part was crucial in learning from my failures and making real change.

9. **Success is often born from failure** – Some of my greatest achievements came only after I stumbled and fell. Failure sometimes forces you to rethink and innovate.

10. **Don’t fear failure** – It’s not something to dread, but something to expect and learn from. Every mistake is an opportunity for personal growth.

# Life Lessons from Failures

As an 80-year-old who's seen his fair share of setbacks, here are ten hard-earned lessons I've gleaned from my failures:

• Never trust a man with a firm handshake but shifty eyes—lost my first business partnership that way back in '68. Character shows itself when nobody's looking.

• Waiting too long to tell Martha I loved her nearly cost me the 54 wonderful years we've had together. Hesitation is the thief of opportunity.

• That business venture in Tulsa taught me you can't cut corners on quality—even when costs run high. My reputation took years to rebuild.

• Not spending more time with my children when they were young. No business success ever filled that hole, and you don't get those years back.

• Ignoring my doctor in my 50s nearly put me in the ground. Pride makes a poor replacement for a healthy heart.

• Standing silent when I should have spoken up against injustice. Moral courage matters more than being comfortable.

• Being stubborn about new technology cost my hardware store dearly in the 90s. The world changes whether you like it or not.

• That summer I lost the family savings on a "sure thing" investment taught me there's no substitute for due diligence.

• Not reconciling with my brother before he passed. Life's too short for grudges—they only poison the one holding them.

• Believing I knew everything in my youth. The older I get, the more I realize how little I truly know. Wisdom starts with humility.

Response as the Dalai Lama:

Ah, my dear friend, it is through the experience of what we perceive as failure that profound wisdom can blossom. For me, the most significant understanding that has arisen is the impermanent nature of all things, including our setbacks. What appears as a great obstacle today will, like all phenomena, eventually pass. Here are some further reflections on this:

* **Embrace the fluidity of reality:** Just as a river flows and changes course, so too do our circumstances. Failure is but one eddy in the stream of life.
* **Cultivate inner peace amidst turmoil:** When faced with disappointment, maintaining a calm mind allows us to see the situation with greater clarity.
* **Recognize the interconnectedness of events:** What we perceive as a personal failure may have roots in a multitude of causes and conditions, both seen and unseen.
* **Practice compassion for oneself:** Just as we extend kindness to others who suffer, we must also offer ourselves understanding and forgiveness when things do not go as planned.
* **See obstacles as opportunities for growth:** Like a muscle that strengthens through resistance, our inner resilience grows through navigating challenges.
* **Let go of attachment to outcomes:** When our happiness is solely dependent on achieving a particular result, we invite suffering when that result is not attained.
* **Focus on the present moment:** Worrying about past mistakes or future uncertainties distracts us from the potential for learning and growth in the here and now.
* **Understand the illusion of a fixed self:** Our sense of "I" can become strongly identified with our successes and failures. Recognizing the impermanent nature of this self allows for greater freedom.
* **Maintain a long-term perspective:** From the vastness of time, a single setback is but a fleeting moment. Our journey towards enlightenment encompasses many such experiences.
* **Dedicate oneself to the benefit of others:** When our primary motivation is to serve others, our personal disappointments become less significant in the grand scheme of things.
