Hi Angie

Sorry for the slow reply

Dining service provides the best, most resident-pleasing experience at Heritage on the Marina.

As editor of the newsletter, I think of ways to:

* Deepen the relationship between residents and the Dining Room
* Inform and remind residents of future events and things to look forward to
* Express the gratitude of being part of a highly diverse community

Any efforts:

* Should come naturally
* Be part of the normal work flow
* Require minimal effort by anybody

My thought is to add a Dining Service section to the monthly Residents Council President's letter that includes a few lines about the dining room. (I draft these for Patrick ;-)

The section could include:

* Copy paste text of unterest from the Leadership Update notes
* Mention the date of the birthday dinner and the number of residents who attended
* List any holiday or special meals
* Identify the superfood of the month

Here is a quick draft of what the section could look like for June:

Dining Services Update

The June birthday dinner is scheduled for June 12th. The table is likely to be full because we have eight birthdays and four with spouses. The table will be decorated by Yvonne and Key. There will be a Father's Day midday dinner on June 27th. The June superfood of the month is ???. Felt chair sliders have been installed on the dining room chairs and have received positive reviews.

And I just had a flash of inspiration: I wil try to get a comment or quote from the Chairperson of the Food Committee.

Does this look OK to you? Will you know the superfood of the month by the middle of the week? Are any other special meals planned for June? I will send you a draft of the newsletter for your approval before it goes out.

What would be icing on the cake would be a quote from a team member about perhaps something fun to look forward to in June.
