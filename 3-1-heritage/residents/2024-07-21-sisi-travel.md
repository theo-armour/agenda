Hello Lin, I am a resident of Heritage and a friend of your mother. She is asking me for help regarding the ability to travel to Finland. She tells me she does not want to pay to have somebody to accompany her, but staff here say she must. Please, before I go any further, can we have a chat about this? Theo Armour / t.armour@gmail.com
