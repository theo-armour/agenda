# 2024-10-20 Residents Roses of 3400 Laguna

Greetings Heritage Residents,

The Roses of 3400 Laguna

https://heritage-happenings.github.io/#pages/2024/eir/the-roses-of-3400-laguna.pdf

As part of the Heritage on the Marina Strategic Plan, the San Francisco Planning department is reviewing a Draft Environmental Impact Report and an application to list the Morgan building in the San Francisco Landmark Register.

I prepared and submitted comments to both of these and want to share them with you. My comments highlight the importance of roses as a significant feature of the decorations in the Morgan building.

My theory is that Julia Morgan chose the rose as the predominant symbol because it is a symbol of love. I will be investigating this further and will share updates (and better photos) with you.

In the meantime, I hope you enjoy the many photos in the document and that you start to see the roses in the building in a new light.
