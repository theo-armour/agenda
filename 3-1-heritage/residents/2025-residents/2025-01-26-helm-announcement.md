# 2025-01-26 Helm Announcement

Howdy Residents

Helm Music will perform

Monday, January 27 at 3pm in Friendship Hall

Helm will be performing a range of Egyptian music from folkloric to classical styles, both vocal and instrumental.

A variety of traditional woodwinds and percussion instruments will introduce you to some of the styles you would find in Egypt both past and present.

Yours truly came up with the introduction to Helm.

Ling Shien Bell is my brother-in-laws sister-in-law.

Be there or be square

Cheers,

Theo
