Hi Yvonne

Thank you for the card (with its nice message) and the wine and the loan of the beautiful bottle bag. I look forward to celebrating over the weekend.

And it's nice to be able to agree that trying to make the world a better place is the nicest, most useful and right thing we can do.

Cheers,

Theo

Dear Linda and Tony

Thank you for your wonderful birthday wishes card.

The wishes are great, but it's the Crane paper that's wonderful! ;-)

Cheers,

Theo
