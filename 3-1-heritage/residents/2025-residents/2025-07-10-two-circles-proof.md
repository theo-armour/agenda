# 2025-07-10 Two Circles Proof


The radius of a circle is constant

Therefore in each of the circles, the distance from the centers to the two points of tangency are equal (isosceles triangle)

when a triangle has sides of equal length, the angles with the third side are equal.

the angle AB makes with L1
is the compliment of the angle c1B makes with AB



The angle BC makes with L1 is the compliment of the angle c2B makes with BC
