# 2025-02-10 "Collete Uncensored" Soiree

Hello Nancy, Lillemor, Karl, and Patrick

See the details below.

It's more fun to go together as as group. Since Patrick is leaving early, I suggest that Nancy, Lillemor, Karl and I qo together.

If uou are all OK with this, I will order an Uber XL for the four of us at 6:15 with pickup at 1550 Francisco Street.

Cheers,

Theo

WHAT: Savories and wine will be served for you to enjoy, followed by Lorri Holt’s theatre performance as “Colette Uncensored.”

DRESS CODE: Festive

## A few things to keep in mind:

Parking & Transportation: We’re expecting about 90 people and an equally ambitious number of wine bottles. If you live in San Francisco, consider taking an Uber, Waymo, or taxi so we can leave parking spaces for those making the pilgrimage from faraway lands.

Layer Up: The theater seats 500, which means the room can get a little chilly. Bring a stylish shawl, a dashing jacket, or, if you’re feeling bold, a vintage Colette-inspired cape.

Shoe Strategy: There will be stairs. If you were considering 8-inch heels, I applaud your confidence but advise against it—graceful stair ascents are hard enough sober.

COVID Precautions: If you’d like to wear a mask, please feel free. No judgment, just vibes.

Accessibility: If the entrance stairs pose a challenge, there’s a back door to the right of the building—just ask, and we’ll be happy to guide you.

Payment (A Gentle Reminder): If you haven’t had a chance to pay yet, kindly send your check or use Zelle when you can. Your future self, sipping wine and watching Colette come to life, will thank you.
