## Personal Background

Until I was sent to boarding school at the age of 12, I frequently created drawings such as maps of Robinson Crusoe's Island, side views of battleships, tanks and bombers, castles and fortresses, and - a crowd pleaser - side view of JEEPs outfitted to carry everything needed for a picnic.

I often wonder how my skills might have developed had I been giving drawing lessons. Ultimately, I became an architect and then a software developer. In the process, I became a fast and skilled technical draftsman both in 2D and 3D. I have always regretted never developing my drawing skills for sketching. I have taken life drawing classes and tried cartooning and sketching landscapes. But I never happily carried a sketchbook and sketched a building or a cityscape. I have always been envious of those who could. I have always been a technical draftsman, not an artist. Some of my excuses:

◯ Drawing in a sketchbook is not easy when you have only one hand<br>
◯ The time it takes to create a good drawing is a challenge. Unless you are thoroughly experienced, it takes much time and many sketches to create a good sketch. When you see a lovely sketch, it also incorporates the hundreds of hours it took to develop the skill to create it. It is not just the time it took to make that one sketch. I am very stingy with my time.<br>
◯ A drawing is a representation of something. I prefer designing the "something" rather than sitting around trying to figure out how to represent it.

## Medium and Techniques

The initial sketches were done on the backs of memos sent out by the office - mainly using felt tip pens and annotated with a 2B pencil. My first drawing was the Coco Channel exercise.

Later works were done using various computer software, drawn with a stylus on a computer screen, and printed on thick sheets of paper obtained from the art room.

Generally, a drawing was started around 11:45 and was finished by around noon - in time for lunch. Occasionally, a drawing took much longer as I evolved a new technique or tried a new medium.

I started the exercise started in August 2020 and continued until 2022. After that, I created drawings using Artificial Intelligence and displayed these on a computer monitor.

After that, my creative skills focused on designing and publishing _Heritage Happenings_.

## Themes

The drawings tended to follow themes. Some of the themes were:

### Birthdays

On birthdays, I often searched out the residents and asked what drawing they would like to see. In several instances, I repeatedly drew the item many times until there were the number of items corresponding to the age of the resident. For example, the drawing for Sheila shows eighty-eight martini glasses.

### Holidays

On several holidays, I drew holiday settings

### Artists Coloring Books
The Louise Bourgeois and Giacometti drawings are examples.

### People wearing Sombreros

Sometimes, I was lazy and ripped off the idea from the book _CéKoiCa?! - C'est un Mexicain qui..._ by Martin Berthommier.

### Single Line drawings
I have always been fascinated by Picasso's single-line drawings. I have tried to emulate this style in several drawings.

## Why Did I Stop?

I created these images so as to provide residents passing through the corridor with something to smile at during the long, lonely pandemic isolation. All of these drawings took effort on my part. They were not part of an activity that comes naturally to me. In other words, it was yet another attempt to see if I could develop my paper drawing skills in ways that would be gratifying to me.And, in many ways, I did not stop. I just focused on other things. I am a designer and a developer. Computers are my medium. Fingers crossed: They will pull the keyboard out of my cold dead hand.

## The Future

I dream of finding collaborators to generate images for display and enjoyment on the Internet. My hero, Picasso, invented new ways of using your eyes. I believe his efforts could be updated, extrapolated and extended into models for the future of art. I want to be part of that future.
