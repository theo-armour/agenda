Hi Jill

See attached zip file.

BTW, I am in the process of rethinking my entire Heritage Happenings publishing process.

Some quite blunt observations in particular relating to the calendar.
Of the 50 or so family and friends that I have sent the calendar to over the past several years, you are the only one who has ever in any way taken any interest in the effort.  
The calendar is prepared by residents based on a file provided by Activities. I no longer have anything to do with its preparation.
Though I am no longer involved, I have continued the responsibility of sending it out to you, but in most retirement communities calendars are prepared and sent out entirely by staff. BTW, They are inevitably more informed and entertaining about upcoming activities than the calendar is sent out by Heritage. .
The calendar, just like the activities suggested by the activities department, has diminished in quality over the last four or five years. The calendar is emblematic of an impoverished activities program. We can see a sure sign of this in a recent financial study review that shows the activities department underspent its budget by $50,000.
Informing family and friends who, apart from you, don't seem to care about a diminished and impoverished activity schedule seems not to be, or should not be, high on my list of priorities. 
;-)

Your thoughts?

Cheers,

Theo
