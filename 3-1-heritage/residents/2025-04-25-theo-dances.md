I'm a resident in a resident care facility for the elderly, running for the board of directors of the society. 

The following is an amusing email to send to residents to help them engage with the upcoming election. It is intended to be a humorous sideline to the actual event. It is not intended to be taken seriously.

Please help me come Up with a closing sentence or two. 

```
Dear residents,

At the Residents Council meeting on April 25, we discussed non-disclosure agreements. If elected to the Board of Directors, I would be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement. This is standard practice for board members, and I am willing to comply with this requirement.

Nonetheless, I believe that it is important to state that ultimately, I am about open disclosure. I believe that the more we share, the more we learn. I am not a fan of secrecy, and I will do my best to ensure that our community is as open and transparent as possible.

In order to demonstrate my commitment to this principle, I have decided to share my dance with you. I hope that you will find it entertaining and informative.

My friend Myra Krieger earns money by writing biographies of people. She has written a biography of me.

Imagine seeing a photo of yourself with a drone in your mouth sitting in a bar described as a "computer nerd".

Perhaps the events later that day are even more revealing. The two you friends I had for Friday night dinner invited me to a rock concert. I ended up on the stage with the band dancing for an hour.

It was an amazing evening. Nonetheless my behavior was not appropriate for a board member let alone being insane, dangerous and risky. I cringe looking at every one of the images.

So, while my dance moves might be questionable, my dedication to open communication isn't. If elected to the Board, let's make some sensible decisions together â€“ off the dance floor.
