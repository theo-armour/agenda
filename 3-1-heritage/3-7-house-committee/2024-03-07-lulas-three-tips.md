# Three LULA Issues

Draft

Hi Christina

>>Thank you for your submission on behalf of the group.

My submission was a draft sent only to you and to Hector. It was not "on behalf of the group". I am sorry that I did not make that clear.

My having submitted a draft without consulting other residents was also an error. I apologize for that.

I think it would be best if I were to recuse myself from this discussion.

Three Heritage on the Marina (HotM) LULA issues that need to be addressed:

* Numerous HotM Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) need to be reviewed, updated and implemented
* SOPs and other relevant HotM documents need to be readily available on phones or tablets
* LULAs should have sliding or sliding folding doors
