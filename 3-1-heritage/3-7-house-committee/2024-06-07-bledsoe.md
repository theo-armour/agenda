Hello Pam and Bob
I have attached 2 files: "House Committee Charter" and "Three Ugly Things".
I hope you will have a look at them and consider making some comments. The primary concern is that documents like these are circulated to residents must be understandable and readable by most residents and team members.
Please feel free either to discuss this at breakfast sometime or to send back written comments.
Theo
