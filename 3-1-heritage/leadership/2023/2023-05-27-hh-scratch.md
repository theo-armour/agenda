The Joys and Privileges of Volunteering at The Heritage

Activities at The Heritage are organized by the residents and the Activities Department working together. Some activities have arisen in response to our own needs, some by thoughtful planning by staff and some by gifts to our community. The Visual Arts Committee, for example, began with a grant from a long-time contributor who thought that a new van and a fund to provide for "Out & About" would be good for residents who cannot get out easily. Administration provides funds for lectures and concerts.

Residents can participate in various ways. One can join specific committees in their individual interests, such as gardening, the library or music programs. One can sign up to decorate a birthday table. There is a large white loose-leaf book on the first table in the dining room corridor, labeled: 2023 Committee Book. One can sign to join an ongoing activity or consult with Karina Tapia about a new idea.

Activities and resident participation fell off dramatically during the Covid epidemic. Prior to that, there was a great deal of cohesive planning and execution of resident activities. Participating in this community was part of the charm and satisfaction of living here; the feeling of mutual responsibility shared by a happy family. The more able shop for others less well able to do it themselves. We can accompany or drive others to medical appointments.

At present, we are still experiencing low attendance at programs and a serious shortage of new hands decorating birthday tables. This is an invitation to consider joining in , to become an even greater part of Heritage life.

Roxana Lara
Assistant Director of Life Enrichment


A First-Generation San Franciscan, Roxana is one of Five children. The daughter of immigrants from Santa Ana, El Salvador/ Calabria, Italy.

Roxana studied black and white photography at the Academy of Art and graduated from SFSU with a Double Major in Cinema Production & Philosophy.

While at State she made a film about her father, who became ill later in life and needed a tracheotomy to survive. The film is called Breathing Room and it is a 5 -minute short that went on to win awards at film festivals. She followed this up with her senior thesis, her film called Shade of Atonement, a 1950s period piece which is based on a folklore legend- all her films, are filmed in black and white (She loves it).

After graduation, she moved on to be a Cinematographer/ Camera Assistant in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Roxana worked on several films such as “The Rock” as well as the TV show “Nash Bridges, ” as a production assistant which had San Francisco locales. She was also a casting assistant for every Robin Williams movie shot in SF.

Cinematography was what she wanted to do forever but it was a competitive and male-dominated field. A career switch made sense and Roxana thought to herself, ”What about the senior care industry,” Her understanding of the needs of seniors started when she made the film on her father and from being around him. However, it was an unusual side of senior care that became her first job in the field. She landed in the senior care Transportation division of BART collaborating with seniors and people with disabilities. And being fluent in Spanish and Italian helped with several opportunities.

This led to a job at the SFMTA working in accessible service for a new program called Shop Around. The city received a federal grant to do this program which was to provide a grocery shopping shuttle for seniors and people with disabilities in food deserts like the Outer Bayshore and Hunters Point. It started with eight seniors, and Roxana expanded it to a city-wide program. Before she left, the program had expanded to include 3,000 seniors.

She did Public Relations/ Outreach for five years when another program came out of it called Van Go. It filled a need for seniors to get rides to Giants games and/ or a senior center for the day. Two programs were now in place.

Roxana pivoted to working in senior facilities, the first being Alma Via, where she collaborated with residents with dementia and Alzheimer’s . After a year, Roxana became the Director of Life Enrichment. She then moved on to be Program Manager for Bernal Heights Senior Center. Where she was also involved with Marin food bank, which distributed groceries for home bound seniors and did this during Covid in addition to providing hot meals …. for a time, she was The Marketing Director for The Village in SF and then went on to On Lok where she oversaw programming in person and on virtual platforms …. Then Heritage came calling.

Roxana has had two distinct careers, and now she is going to law school virtually. Currently her classes are with Pepperdine. And, oh yes, she is engaged but hasn’t set the date yet.

Maureen Perron
Margaret Jacobs

Maureen was born in 1944 in San Diego where she grew up attending Catholic school. Her mother had been a teacher and her father was a business owner in the city. True to the times, her father recommended that she choose a profession that didn’t require competition with men. Dietetics seemed to fit the bill.

Desiring a Catholic college, Maureen chose Lone Mountain in San Francisco which she attended for two years. She then returned to live at home and pursue her major at the State University of San Diego. Asked what she most enjoyed at school, she replied “learning.”

While at Lone Maountain, Maureen met her husband who attended USF; they were married when she graduated. He worked in finance, which meant he had to leave for work at 4 o'clock every morning for the opening of the NY Stock Exchange, so she became a full time mother.

Not the kind of person to stay at home, Maureen engaged in community work, demonstrating her considerable organizing skills in founding nonprofit programs in San Mateo County.

Research found that babies born in Mexico whose families had moved to the United States had poor teeth because of having to drink sugar-laden juice in place of contaminated water. With her dentist, his wife, and a friend she founded Sonrisis (Smiles) Dental Clinic in Half Moon Bay. She also discovered the need to address childhood obesity that was rampant in the local farm worker community. Lack of healthy food choices led to poor health outcomes. Approaching her county government for opportunities to help, she found a willing partner.

This is the published description of the non-profit program Maureen developed. “In 2005, while working with the Coastside Health Committee with connections to the San Mateo County Department of Public Health, Maureen received grant funds from Kaiser Permanente to address the health needs of low income students in schools on the coast, and so The HEAL Project (Health, Environment, Agriculture and Learning) was born.” Two years later, through the agency of the County Health Department Maureen was given access to two acres of farm land in Half Moon Bay and funding to develop the San Mateo County School Farm. Students from across San Mateo County would come to the farm and learn to grow, harvest and eat healthy produce. The article closes with the following: “Maureen's involvement with THP and seeing the programs grow over the years has been a great gift.”
In 2008, Maureen was inducted into the San Mateo County Womens’ Hall of Fame for her contributions to her county.
Maureen’s home was in Half Moon Bay where, as she described it, “there's nothing but the ocean on one side and open space on the other side and you can walk for an hour and a half or two hours along the ocean and come back.”

Another aspect of Maureen’s volunteer work is her membership in an international organization of people with spiritual interests who look ahead to the future with optimism. She meets locally with people who share this calling and is connected on-line with people from all over the world.

Maureen has two daughters. Celeste and her husband have two children in high school and live in San Francisco. Stephanie lives in Marin with her husband and three stepchildren. So all together, five grandchildren close by!

Maureen quickly became part of the Heritage on the Marina community, taking on the responsibility (with Kay Tim) to keep the McGinley terrace beautiful with flowering plants. She lives in Morgan Hall in Apt 241. Her phone # is (650) 867-3579.



Meeting the Neighbors
Margaret Jacobs

I had a delightful visit with Charmly and Tucker Ingham in Apt 206P (just opposite
the elevator) and admired their artfully planned use of space for both beauty,
comfort and freedom of movement. The purpose of the visit was to learn more
about this newest couple joining our community. Here is some of what I learned.

Charmly was born in McMinnville, Oregon in 1939, but spent most of her growing-up years in Toledo, Washington, a town of (give or take) 500 people. At age 17 she was off to the University of Washington where she received her B.A. in Business. After some secretarial jobs, she returned to university to obtain teaching credentials and began an enjoyable career teaching first in junior high school and then at community college.

Tucker, now 83 years old, grew up in Seattle and obtained his BA at the University of Washington. His career has been in English Departments, at first in high school, and then primarily in Contra Costa Community College.

Tucker and Charmly met on a blind date arranged by friends in 1964 and were married 6 months later. Together they have enjoyed life in the Bay Area, as well as taking over 30 trips overseas. They often traveled to France where a favorite niece lives.

They have each pursued the use of their talents and interests. Charmly, musically talented, sang with the Lamplighters, performing in 13 performances of each of 5 shows. She sang in the Oakland Symphony Chorus, and was a soloist in church choirs. Her church was also the center for serving on committees. Her love of the arts found the couple regularly at the Ballet, Symphony and museums.

Tucker recalls the enthusiasm he felt participating in LBJ.s “War on Poverty”. In 1973 he started Contra Costa Community College’s Learning Center, designed to improve the performance of students with poor learning skills. In his leisure time, he kept the 1971 Jaguar, already 7 years old when he bought it, working as the family car for 50 years, using the mechanical skills he had practiced during his 6 years in the Naval Reserve.

Tucker and Charmly are delighted with the food at Heritage on the Marina. Tucker particularly loves beer on Friday Nights, and bacon, eggs and hash browns in the morning. They both are enthusiastic museum goers, love architecture, and say they chose Heritage on the Marina because of the ambiance of this Julia Morgan building. They are pleased to tell you that they have an old fashioned TV, no computer or other device, and a land line only.
