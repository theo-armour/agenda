## TL;DR

I want to scream!

The Horror of Preparing Residents Council Notes of Meeting

* Meeting was too long
* No prepared text notes were sent out
* No action items were called for during the meeting
* Little or no resident-to-resident interaction occurred

Let's work on fixing these issues!

Next. a bit of personal horror followed by my suggestions for fixing the problems

## Extra Bonus Horror

The most recommended transcription service is https://Otter.ai. I've been using it the past few meetings - and it sucks. Recordings are virtually incomprehensible because Otter requires a good connection to the Internet - which Friendship Hall does not have.

I did ask Maintenance for a connection from the amp to the computer connection, but that was not set up by the time of the meeting. I want to give up on Otter, but I have not found a better solution.

In any case, this will not solve the problem of the especially bad recording of this past meeting. Nor does it help that in this recent meeting, team members spoke for over an hour, and only Mary prepared and sent out written notes.

In past meetings, transcribing the bad recordings and preparing the notes has been taking me something like five to eight hours of very unpleasant work. I am not going to do that again.

### What People Say They Want
I am conflicted about the value of the notes of residents council meetings.

When I talk to some people about the notes of the meeting, they say, "Just do a one-page summary". It's the modern way. It avoids liability. It avoids having to be accountable. It avoids having to do any work.

On the other hand, when I talk to others, they say things like:

BTW

Personally, the history of Heritage is important to me, and I want to leave a good record of what happened for the historians of the future.

I also want to leave a good record of what happened for the people who are going to be making decisions about Heritage in the future


## Suggestions

A good thing might be to propose a new format for the Residents Council (RC) meetings

### Revamp the Meeting Time and Format

* Future Residents Council meetings shall be limited to one hour or less
* Staff talks should be limited to a total talk time of 30 minutes
* At the end of the 30 minutes, the staff should be allowed to return to their normal duties
* The remaining portion of the RC meeting is used for resident-to-resident interaction

### Improve the comprehension by residents/ Simplify Documentation Preparation

* Staff shall prepare and send out an online slide document prior to the meeting
* Text of slides shall readable by slightly visually impaired residents sitting at the maximum distance from the screen
* Notes of Meetings shall be based on the slides
* Off-the-cuff remarks will only be noted upon requests of the speakers
* Relevant Q&A may be noted

Implement Moderation

* The resident portion of the RC meeting shall have an agenda and
* The resident portion of the RC meeting shall be moderated
* An objective of the RC meeting shall be to agree well-formed actions items
* Action items will be determined by residents and forwarded to staff by email for discussion and implementation

Leverage Technology

* Resident council meetings shall be recorded shared (live?) via Zoom or similar,
* The audio shall transcribed, summarized by AI and made available to staff and residents
* Exploration of modern meeting management technology and techniques shall be encouraged

Let's work together to improve the quality of our meetings and leave a lasting record of Heritage for future generations.

Let us help residents become useful "eyes and ears" that observe and report on the running of a successful community.
