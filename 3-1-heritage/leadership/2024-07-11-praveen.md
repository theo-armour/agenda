Hi Praveen

Thank you very much for your time and advice yesterday. I am grateful for your observations and suggestions.

I hope we can find ways of informing residents of upcoming events and activities that are more effective than the current methods. I am looking forward to working with you on this.

I attach a copy of the of the July events sent by Activities.
