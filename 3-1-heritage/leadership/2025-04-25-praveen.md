* Residents Council vote on Heritage Happenings. 
* Heritage Happenings is too much for me.
* Activities department is a fail.  
* Need a copy editor? 
* If I stop, what happens? 
* Does anybody in leadership care? 
* Can this place survive with just a crappy calendar? 
* Does this place actually need activities? 
* Can an activities department be outsourced?
