# 2023-12-12 Life Enrichment Meeting

Hi Karina, Stephen and Roxana

Isabelle, my former wife arrived today and will be staying here unril Thursday. I'm not sure what my schedule will be like tomorrow. I will try to be at the meeting, but I may be late or have to leave early.

In any case, here are some notes for the meeting.

## RSV Vaccine Clinic

Given the success of the virus and flu clinic, how about a RSV vaccine clinic some day?

## Photo Albums

Currently there is a Google Photos album where Stephen can add photos. Unfortunately, it is not easy for others to add photos.

Is it now possible to share a Microsoft 365 online folder with others so that we can all add photos?

## Heritage Happenings Calendar

I have sent Karina a draft Microsoft Word version of the Calendar. Once she has added the daily events, I cam add the movies. I already have NancyO's list of movies. Still need Stephen's list of movies.

## Heritage Happenings Newsletter Photos

We are still working om standardizing the format of the newsletter and ways to make it easier to add content to the newsletter.

The first two or three pages of Special Events and Activities is beginning to take shape.

Wherever possible there is a photo of the main presenter of the event. This is important for the residents to see who is presenting the event. It also really helps new residents and residents with memory issues to put a name the the face of Activities staff.

If there is no photo of the presenter, then a logo of the organization or or perhaps oan image of the previous year's event is OK. Please no random clip-art

So please help source a good photo. Usually just supplying a link to the presenter presenter's web site is good enough

## Heritage Happenings Newsletter Text

Generally there is room for just two or three lines of text. If there is more text wanted the we can add a special note at the end of the events. We did this already with Roxana's film and the Day of the Dead event.
