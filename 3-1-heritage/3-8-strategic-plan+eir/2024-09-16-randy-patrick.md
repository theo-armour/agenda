Hi Randy and Patrick

This message is about the Draft Environmental Impact Report, 3400 Laguna Street Project.

I am a proponent of the Strategic Plan. I have drafted a number of points and am preparing a paper to present to the Planning Commission. It has become too long to present at the hearing. I will email it to the Commission and having it checked by you.

My question at this time is what are some good tactics and tips for residents who are proponents of the Strategic Plan to use at the hearing?

I plan to send a message to residents giving them a heads-up about the hearing.

There are may some residents who are not proponents of the Strategic Plan. What might be some good tactics and tips to counter their remarks at the hearing?
