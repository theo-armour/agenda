Are there any RCFE facilities in San Francisco, California that offer actual memory care, not just memory support? with links

I like the Sequoias

My guesses / opinions:

Heritage is too small to deal with a wide type of dementia issues. We are excellent with people who have next to no agency. We are not so good with lively ones.

Even though we could deal with a variety of patients outside our usual range, any new thing becomes disruptive and we are already understaffed (because we are so small)

Look for an organization that has 100+ patients in dementia care and is associated with a large organization that has full middle management capabilities.

Not to worry about my time. I'm keeping what I learned here in a set of notes. At my age, learning how people grow old is quite instructive, actually.
