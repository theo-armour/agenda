# Brittany Monthly Talks

Hi Brittany

One of the missions of Heritage Happenings is to help residents to remember to maintain healthy habits.

It would be great to have a page (or two) on health in the newsletter every month. I hope that you and Jonathan, Martha, Mary, Dining Services, Pine Park Health, a resident or two and I can make this happen.

Things that I have found helpful in the past are:

* There is a schedule of health topics for the year that covers most of the important health issues for the very elderly.
* Much of the material is already prepared and its authoritativeness is assured.
* The material would be useful not just to  readers of the newsletter but would also spur talks, activities, dining experiences, outings and whatever else we can think of.

I have started to source material to guide the project. Here is one of the projects that I have found:

https://www.ncoa.org/article/aging-mastery-program-core-curriculum/

We might subscribe to this program ourselves, join a local group or just use the material as a guide.

Anyway, all of this is just thinking out loud. I am copying my niece Mia who helps me with the newsletter.

I will be delighted to hear your thoughts.

Cheers,

Theo
