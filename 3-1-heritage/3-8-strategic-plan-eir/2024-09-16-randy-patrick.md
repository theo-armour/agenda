Hi Randy and Patrick

This message is about the Draft Environmental Impact Report, 3400 Laguna Street Project.

I am a proponent of the Strategic Plan. I have drafted a number of points and am preparing a paper to present to the Planning Commission. It has become too long to present at the hearing. I will email it to the Commission and having it checked by you.

My question at this time is what are some good tactics and tips for residents who are proponents of the Strategic Plan to use at the hearing?

I plan to send a message to residents giving them a heads-up about the hearing.

There are may some residents who are not proponents of the Strategic Plan. What might be some good tactics and tips to counter their remarks at the hearing?

Residents response to EIR

Hello Randy and Patrick

Regarding the EIR, I would like to send residents a reminder of the public hearing in City Hall on September 26.

An EIR is a high technical document which many people have difficulty understanding. The invitation residents received from Planning lists many things not to say, but it does not give any tips or guidance on what should or could be said.

Could somebody in the Strategic Plan group prepare provide some text that I could use to inform residents about how they may help the project forward. These could be tips and tricks from Rockford or Page & Turnbull. It would be very helpful to have some guidance on how to present to the Planning Commission.
