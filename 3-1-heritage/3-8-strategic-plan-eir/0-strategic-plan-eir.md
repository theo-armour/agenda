The purpose of the public hearing is for the San Francisco Planning Commission and San Francisco Planning staff to receive comments on the adequacy and accuracy of the draft EIR. The commission will not respond to any of the comments or take action on the project at this hearing. Certification of the Final EIR will be considered at a later hearing. Environmental review focuses on the physical environmental effects of the project. Comments regarding your like or dislike of the project or if you think officials should approve or disapprove the project will not be addressed in the environmental review document. Instead, we encourage you to provide these comments to the planner assigned to review the project for planning code and general plan compliance.  The current planner for this project is Jeffrey Horn, Jeffrey.horn@sfgov.org or 628.652.7366.  Additional information may be found on San Francisco Planningâ€™s website or by contacting the EIR coordinator listed above.
