Hi Hector

A while ago I sent you an email that included a quote from A3 for Julia Morgan building illumination. In that message I said I would be pleased to look for vendors that could supply the equipment at a lower cost.

If you think it's a good idea, I will contact vendors and obtain quotes from them. I will start asking for quotes in the $50K-$75K region. I would prepare a specification of requirements to send out and pass the spec by you first. I will copy you on any messages. I will always state that I am a resident and not an employee.

If you have any suggested vendors, I would be pleased to contact them as well.

What do you think?

Cheers,

Theo
