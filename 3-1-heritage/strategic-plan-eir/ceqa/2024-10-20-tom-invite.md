Hi Tom & Tom

This message covers several topics

* The Heritage Strategic Plan to reinvent itself
* The celebration of the Julia Morgan Building centennial
* The listing of te Julia Morgan Building as a landmark in the National Register of Historic Places

Obviously, I can't cover all of this stuff in one message. I'll start with the Heritage Strategic Plan. The plans are at the Draft EIR stage. The current draft with appendices is 752 pages.

Two things to note:

* I like the strategic Plan and I want it to succeed
* The draft EIR - monster as it is and focussing only on tiny details and not the big picture - omits many relevant and pertinent details.

Me being me, I have taken it upon myself to identify, catalog and document some of the missing details. The happy element is that this initial effort leads into preparing for the Centennial celebration and the National Register of Historic Places listing.

First on overview of the construction

Here are links to the two papers I have sent in as comments to both the Draft EIR and the Landmark application

* https://heritage-happenings.github.io/pages/2024/eir/julia-morgan-building-character-defining-features.pdf

I hope you can skim the Roses paper. It's 90% pictures.

All of this is just to get the ball rolling.

The Julia Morgan building is one of the prettiest mansions in the city. It embodies a host of architectural and social values. It is a treasure that should be celebrated and preserved.

Having only practiced overseas, I have few if any contacts in the city. I am hoping that you can help me get the word out.
