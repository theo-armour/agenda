Message sent to A3 Visual:

The website I am looking at: https://a3visual.com/

My draft email request to A3 is below. Yout thoughts? Any questions?

Greetings A3 Visual team

I don't think I have actually experienced any of your efforts but your web site looks great and I am excited to see what you can do.

I am reaching out as a resident of one of San Francisco's historic Julia Morgan buildings, which will celebrate its centenary in 2025. The current lighting sucks but almost nobody here seems to notice or feel the difference between bad lighting and the many stunning possibilities for accentuating one of San Francisco's most architecturally significant buildings and its historic landscaped garden.

I would like to discuss with you the possibility of a demo or temporary installation that could be used to wake up my peeps and show them what is possible. I would pay for this effort myself. Fingers crossed it would excite people enough to start a real fundraising effort for a state-of-the-art projection lighting system.

I would be pleased to start a dialog with you to discuss this further.

* The person or people to talk to
* Scope of the work for a starter project
* Scope of the work for a full project we envision
* Typical rough range of costs for such projects
* How long it would take to get a demo up and running

As and when we get to some understanding, I will introduce you to the building management and the residents association.

I look forward to hearing from you - and to being enlightened. ;-)

Cheers,

Theo
