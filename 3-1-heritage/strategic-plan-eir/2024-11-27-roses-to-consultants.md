Hello Frank, Susan, Carolyn, and Chris,

Relating to the Draft EIR for 3400 Laguna Street, I sent three documents to the San Francisco Planning Commission and San Francisco Historic Commission. For your reference, here are links to the three documents I sent to the Commissions.

The Roses of 3400 Laguna ~ https://heritage-happenings.github.io/pages/2024/eir/the-roses-of-3400-laguna.pdf
Julia Morgan Building: Character Defining Features ~ https://heritage-happenings.github.io/pages/2024/eir/julia-morgan-building-character-defining-features.pdf
Theo Armour: EIR Comments Cover Letter ~ https://heritage-happenings.github.io/pages/2024/eir/theo-armour-eir-comments-cover-letter.pdf

I would be pleased to receive your observations on these documents. I have never practiced architecture in San Francisco. Kindly excuse any errors and omissions in my comments. I do hope that some of my observations will helpful in adding detail to the the listing of items that are character defining features of the building.

Cheers and happy Thanksgiving,

Theo
