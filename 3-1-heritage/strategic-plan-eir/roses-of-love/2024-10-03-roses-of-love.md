Three roses in the _terracotta_ panels between the second story windows above the two ground floor bays

The roses are highly stylized and centrally positioned within the composition. Each rose is depicted with multiple layers of petals, radiating outward in a symmetrical design. The roses are likely intended as symbolic elements, representing beauty, timelessness, or perhaps even regional or cultural significance.

Their placement suggests a balance in the design, and the meticulous carving indicates a skilled level of craftsmanship. The roses are arranged vertically, with each separated by vine patterns, contributing to a rhythmic and harmonious architectural detail.

The presence of three roses together in architectural decoration can carry several meanings. Historically, the number three has been associated with balance, harmony, and unity in many cultures and artistic traditions. In Christian symbolism, three can represent the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), while in other contexts, it symbolizes life cycles such as birth, life, and death.

In modern symbolism, three roses often represent the phrase "I love you." Each rose is said to correspond to one of the words in the phrase, making a bouquet of three roses a popular romantic gesture. This symbolism has become widely recognized in the context of gift-giving, especially in occasions like anniversaries or Valentine’s Day, where a message of love is intended to be conveyed through the number of flowers.

In the architectural context, this symbolism could still subtly resonate, linking the number three with expressions of affection or deep emotional significance.

It's possible that the roses in the terracotta panel could be Tudor roses, especially if the building draws on historical or classical influences. The Tudor rose is a well-known emblem of England, symbolizing the union of the House of Lancaster (represented by a red rose) and the House of York (represented by a white rose) after the Wars of the Roses. This emblem is frequently used in architecture and heraldry to signify heritage, unity, or even royal patronage.

The design of the roses in your image—with layered petals and prominent central positioning—could be reminiscent of the Tudor rose, particularly if the building's architectural style or history has connections to English design or symbolism. The presence of three Tudor roses might further emphasize a connection to tradition, heritage, or historical references.
