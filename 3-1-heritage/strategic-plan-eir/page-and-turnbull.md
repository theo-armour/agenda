Dear Mr Birkholz,

The draft EIR for the proposed project at 3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco, CA, has been released for public review. There are several references to a paper prepared by Page & Turnbull in the draft EIR referenced as "3400 Laguna Street Historic Resource Evaluation, Part 1 – Revised, Prepared for the San Francisco Planning Department. February 16."

I am a resident of Heritage on the Marina, a former architect (RIBA and HKIA), and a former Program Manager at Autodesk where I designed three releases of AutoCAD. I am very much in favor of the project and would like to help develop a deeper understanding of Julia Morgan's firm, commodious and delightful work.

I am writing to request a copy of the document your office prepared. Please let me know if you can provide a copy of this document or if you can direct me to the appropriate person who can provide a copy.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Theo
