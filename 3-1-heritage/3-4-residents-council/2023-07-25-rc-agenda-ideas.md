# 2023-07-25 Residents Council Ideas


## Cortez McFarland

Suggestion: instead of letting him pontificate, we interview him. Instead of him lecturing us, we question him

### Possible questions

* What are your duties?
* What are your goals?
* What are your plans?
* What are your challenges?
* What are your joys?
* How do you manage all the issues?
* How do you keep track of all the issues?
* How can we help you?
* How can we be your eyes and ears?

### Worxhub

Worxhub may be OK as an issue reporting tool, but it is not useful to the Residents Council officers

* Difficult to share entries
* No send copy to email
* Cannot create campus issues
* How can we establish a campus-wide issue tracking system available to residents?

## Invites

Who shall we invite for next Residents Council meeting?

* Michael Russell
* Lucy (Wellness Nurse)
* David Gruber

## Previous Action Items

* In Mary's email: "Administrator to provide written feedback with 20 days"
* Discuss three action items from last meeting

## New Action Items

* Cottage Uses
* 170th Anniversary Celebration
* Advocates program
* Katie Loo, Recycling & Emplyee Appreciation Fund
