New Business

* Employee Appreciation Fund (EAF)– request made to Jeff Brenner and Jon Casey to
extend the deadline for contributions to the end of November.
* The last report from Jon was that only about $25M has been collected for the EAF
* Theo requested contact emails for those residents whose family takes care of their
financial matters.
* Possible method of making monthly contributions to EAF- Example if all residents made
$100 monthly contribution to the EAF there would be approximately $96M in the fund
at the end of the year. Presuming all 80 residents make the contribution.
* Discussion with Jeff as to accepting new residents on a “Rental Basis” – furnished
studios but a higher rent than what is being paid now by permanent residents. The
Towers are now accepting residents on that basis.


## Jeff

* Good at pushing back: Difficult to to because
* Good at doing things we did not ask for but done because of law suits: exit signs & screens


## False Alarms

See Residents Council June "Action Item #3: False Alarms"

See "Fire Systems Panel Instructions"


## Parlor Talk

* Did not make a proposal.
* Reiterated: we have no money to spend
* if we get rid of new furniture, we look bad in front of the board

My observation about the likely outcome

* Sean and Ed will move furniture to suit Patti & Christmas tree
* Residents will not be consulted

After Christmas
