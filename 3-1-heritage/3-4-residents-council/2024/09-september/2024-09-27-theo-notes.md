## Preface

For the first time in a long time, I am able to attend the Residents Council meeting. Thank you Margaret Jacobs for taking on preparation of the Heritage Happenings Calendar.



## Front of Heritage be illuminated to illustrate architectural features

### Problem with the current lighting situation

During the day, the front of the Morgan building and garden is one of the
beautiful fronts in the City.

But at night the front of the building is dark and uninviting.

The lighting is aimed at the ground and not at the building. The building is not illuminated to show off its architectural features.

Compare and contrast with the lighting for Grace Cathedral, the Ferry Building, City Hell and the Palace of Fine Arts.

A well lit building is a beautiful building. Sometimes even more beautiful at night than during the day.

### Solution: Improve the lighting

The solution is to improve the lighting of the front of the Morgan Building.

Goals:

* Cost: The cost of the project is unknown. It will depend on the design and the materials used.
* Funds: the money comes out of a fundraising effort perhaps as part of the Morgan centenary celebration.
* Design: We need to find a qualified expert lighting designer at a reasonable price
* Benefits: No resident should be impacted by the lighting. The lighting should be designed to eliminate light pollution and not impact the well-being of any resident. On the contrary, residents should feel the lighting enhances the beauty of the building and the garden.


### Goal: Resident-initiated Investigation and Proposal

Three questions need to be answered:

* Money: Can we establish the possibility of a centenary fundraiser? Can we do this at no cost to the annual budget?
* Design: Can we find qualified expert lighting designers at a reasonable price?
* Approval: Can we come up with a pleasing and beautiful night view of the Morgan Building that we residents want to push for?


## EIR Report

Yesterday was the draft EIR public hearing for the project.

There was one public comment by neighbor Tania Alburkerk. She raised the issues of problems the timing of the EIR and Historic Planning Commision investigations not being conducive to fully informed results and the lack of information regarding the Heritage on the Marina financial situation.

Commissioner Kathrin Moore pointed out that the drawings in the report are too small to be read clearly and that the proposed access routes on Bay Street are problematic.

During the hearing, I was in contact with Randy Gridley, CBD, via text messages.

We agreed: Neither of these views were show stoppers. The EIR moves on to the next stage.

I wil be submitting my comments in the next few day. I will share them with you when I do.


## Touchtown app ~

### Support

* Resident Directory: edit your own profile!
* Or ask Tess to help you, install it for you, or update your profile.

### HotM contact: On Thursday I asked John Casey the following:

Who is the day-to-day contact for the Touchtown app?

Installing, launching, and maintaining the app is a service that residents, particularly new residents, will likely need help with. I would like to share their identity with residents.

No reply yet.

### Install Instructions

* I can send them to you by email


## Easy Opening doors

### Problem

There are a number of residents that have a tough time locating their keys, unlocking the door handle and opening the doors to their apartments.

Carm is evidence of this. She has a hard time opening her door and has asked for help.

### Solution

There are a variety of solutions that can be implemented to help residents open their doors more easily. Some of these solutions include:

* Installing a keyless entry system
* Installing a door handle that is easier to grip

If anybody thinks it's a good idea, I can look into it further and see if it's possible to implement.
