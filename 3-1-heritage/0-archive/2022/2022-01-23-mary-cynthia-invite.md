# 2022-01-23 mary cynthia invite

Hi Mary

This Friday I will be 75. I am trying to think of fun and safe things to do

What comes to mind is me having lunch with my daughter Cynthia in the Heritage dining room

Some background:

* Cynthia is vaxxed and boosted, had the virus in January 2021
* She would be tested the day before and upon arrival here - as well as complying with all the normal visitor rules
* The two of us would sit by ourselves at the small table by the fireplace
* We would mask when talking to staff.
* We would request that residents maintain their distance
* We would confirm that nearby windows are open

If you feel this might be OK, I will ask Hanh and Angie if this proposal could be doable under the current situation. I don't want to approach them directly without some idea that this is remotely feasible. They both get so many difficult requests I do not want to add to the list.

Theo
