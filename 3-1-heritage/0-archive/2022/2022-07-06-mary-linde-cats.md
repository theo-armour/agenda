# Cats in the house

Hi Mary

How about we poll the residents on the cat topic?

Can you think of questions to ask residents where the responses would be meaningful and insightful when presented to the Board?

Here is a set of questions that comes to mind:

1. Do you feel OK with allowing residents to keep cats on their apartments?

2. If cats are allowed, would you object to a cat in your wing or floor?

3. If cats are allowed, would you like to have a cat in your apartment?

4. Do you have any comments or suggestions?

I think you might have better ideas for what the Board might like to see.

The request for a poll might be announced at the next Residents Council meeting. Soon after the meeting, the poll questions could be dropped off in resident mailboxes and a ballot box placed in Morgan Hall.
