# Eleanor Burke

Eleanor became my friend twenty years ago. We both attended water aerobics classes at the Bay Club Gateway in the Financial District.

Over the years, we got to know each other better. There were a number of reasons.

When my daughters visited from France, Who invited us to attend a Giants game. Eleanor.

When our aerobics class wanted a Christmas get-together, who threw a party at their place. Eleanor and Bernie

When I escaped to Venice Italy for one of my Peggy Guggenheim Collection board meetings, who of all people would show up at my doorstep wanting to go to a party. The Burkes, of course.

When you needed some extra Christmas presents, a small pile of books of San Francisco Watercolors would appear

So for years I have thought of Eleanor and Bernie as my friends. And as friends I thought I knew them quite well.

Nonetheless the celebration of life at the Tennis Club came almost as a shock.

I realized I was not alone. In the room there were something like 150 people that would agreed with me.

All the nice things that Eleanor and Bernie had done for me, they had also done similar things for all the people in the room. And also for many people here in this room too.

I think I felt this before, but at that event I came to understand that Eleanor and Bernie were not just good friends for me. They were exceptional friends for many.

And I'm sure friendship was quite unique.

And there was a particular characteristic in Eleanor's personality that endeared her to us.

Eleanor wore her heart on her sleeve. You knew what she liked and what she disliked - always.

The best basketball team ever? Stanford Women.

The best food? Vietnamese cooking.

The friendliest country after WWII? West Germany.

The worst baseball club? LA Dodgers.

The best thing to do at a game? Fill in the scorecard.

The most fun game? Bridge.

There was one of Eleanor's joy I was particularly happy to share: the maker of the best artisan chocolate bonbons? Christopher Elbow.

And then there is the reason why I came to be here: The best retirement community? Heritage on the Marina!
