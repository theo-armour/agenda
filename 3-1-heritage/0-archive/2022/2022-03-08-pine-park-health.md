Hi Dr Martin

I hope this message finds you and yor family well.

UCSF have provided me with PCPs I very much respected for over twenty years. You are the third practitioner that I have consulted. You are particularly easy to talk to because you are a good listener. I can say that I have always felt positive about my various health outcomes because you have directed my care so well.

As you know, I now reside at the Heritage on the Marina. The increased sociability, the more varied and healthier diet, the freedom of not having to worry about not growing old have resulted in my not coming to see your since 2020.

Nonetheless I feel this does not bode well for a life heading toward the eighties. Feeling well means that you feel you do not need to seek care or guidance. For example, I've not had a blood pressure reading, cholesterol reading or dermatology scan in months.

I guess I am not alone. Convenient medical access seems to be a thing. The Heritage is planning to offer the services of https://pineparkhealth.com to independent living residents here. Pine Park's slogan is "We bring clinical staff right into senior living communities, providing safer, more convenient urgent and primary care."

The idea of being able to walk down a flight of stairs and a few hundred feet in order to see health provider or get a blood draw oe whatever is highly attractive. There is also the possibility that this Google-funded entry may enable a more intuitive EMR access than MyChart. And who knows, there may be some emphasis on wellness and coaching rather than therapy and treating.

So this is to let you know that I am going to have a go with Pine Park. You will likely receive requests for my records before too long. Note that in trying to meet or exceed your level of care, they will not have an easy row to hoe.

If there is any way, I may inform UCSF management of you talents and care, do let me know. In any case, please accept my deepest thanks for you being my good doctor.
