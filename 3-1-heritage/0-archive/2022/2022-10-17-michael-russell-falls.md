Hello Michael

I hope this message finds you coping well with all the stresses of home and work life.

I write to let you know that I will be asking the officers of the Heritage on the Marina Residents Council to send you an invitation to prepare a report for presentation at next the Residents Council meeting to be held on Friday October 28.

Your report could cover:

* A description the events surrounding the injuries to Margaret Johnson and Shirley Ertola while they were boarding the bus to go to the fall picnic as well as any other observed concerns that may have occurred during the excursion
* The lessons learned from these issues and experiences
* The proposed actions and guidance Heritage will initiate to prevent or mitigate such incidents from occurring in the future

The Council officers will meet on Thursday evening. I expect that a message to you with something like the above contents will be sent to you soon thereafter. I am informing you of this process in order to help give you time to consider these matters.

Hello Residents Council Officers

The fall picnic excursion to Samuel P Taylor Park was for most of the participants a welcome and enjoyable experience. Nonetheless there were issues and conditions that were hurtful, distressing and avoidable.

We, as eyes and ears of the organization, need to report to staff that we feel that a situation has occurred that needs remedying. And in response, we would like hear about the remedies staff plan to implement. A suitable venue for such a discussion will be the next meeting of the Residents Council.

Below is a draft of a message to Michael Russell that we can discuss at our Thursday evening meeting.

Michael is a suitable recipient because
