Hi Michael

At last Thursday meeting of the HotM Residents Council officers meeting, regarding my previous message to you of October 17 relating to the falls that occurred during our excursion on October 13 to to Samuel P Taylor Park, my draft to you was noted, no actions were agreed and so be it.

Personally, I am still interested in how this matter will be dealt with. Will a written report on the incident be drafted by HotM staff? If so, will it be be available to the public?
