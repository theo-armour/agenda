HotM Residents Council Notes for the August Meeting

Hello Heritage on the Marina residents and staff

Kindly find attached the notes for the August meeting of the Heritage on the Marina Residents Council held on August 26th.

The notes continue to develop the mission of delivering aging-friendly news and reports. You may notice two notable aspects of this month's notes:

* The text is written as a "narrative" or a storytelling. It tries to explain what has or will happen with the many aspects of life at Heritage in an open-ended manner.
* Topics have a title that tends to repeat from month to month to help you identify ongoing efforts. For example, Mary Linde most always has updates on the "Strategic Plan" and Hanh Ta frequently reminds us of "Updates and guidelines for prevention and management of Covid-19"

Hoping the effort pleases you,

Theo Armour
Secretary, Heritage on the Marina (HotM) Residents Council
