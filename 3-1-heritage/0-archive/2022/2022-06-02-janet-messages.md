Send Janet your farewell and thank you message

Hello Heritage residents

At the request of Mary and with the approval of the Residents Council, a message board for farewell and thank you messages has been initiated for Janet. Kindly feel free to add your good thoughts!

Click this link: https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/ypzixauP

Some time in June all our good thoughts on the message board will be collected and transformed into a hardbound book which will then be presented to Janet.

Because many residents are not on the Internet, messages will also be collected from a sheet on the dining room corridor sign-up table. These hand-written messages will then be transcribed to this message board.

Please: help spread the word and encourage others to send messages!
