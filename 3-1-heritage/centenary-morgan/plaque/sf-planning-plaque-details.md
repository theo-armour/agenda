We suggest paying for a bronze plaque, as it holds up better over time. The aluminum plaques with bronze colored coating discolors quickly so we do not suggest using that.

South Bay Bronze should have our template, so just let them know you want a San Francisco City Landmark Plaque. They will send us a proof for review.

Landmark Plaque.

See below screenshot. These cost about $1100 per plaque plus shipping. Unfortunately the Planning Department does not currently have any funding to help cover the costs. You would be responsible for developing the text, which should be kept short (just a few sentences long). I would then proof the text. We need to review/edit very thoroughly as we have had past problems with misspellings on past plaques.

Plaques are to be placed on the facade of the building facing the main street. If the main entrance is on the front of the building, plaques should be placed to the left or right of the door. If the main entrance is on the side of the building, plaques should be placed near the corner of the building facing the main street. Place the plaque approximately fifty-one (51) inches from the ground to the lower edge of the plaque. The center of the plaque should be at about eye level, or approximately sixty (60) inches from the ground. It is important that it not be attached to the building in such a way that it might damage historic materials. The back of the plaque has a concealed mounting system. Rods are screwed into the back of the plaque into raised mounting holes. Bonding cement, such as “Liquid Nails” or similar construction adhesive (available at hardware stores and auto part stores) holds the rods in holes that have been drilled into the wall.
