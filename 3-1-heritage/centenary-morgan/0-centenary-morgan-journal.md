Hello Woody &amp; Kerri
It was a delight meeting up with you both last week. Fingers crossed: many more similar meetups to come.
Thank you for preparing the four page selection from the January SF Heritage News publication.
Our CEO, Mary Linde very much appreciates your effort and would like to make it available as a reprint for our March centenary celebration as well as for distribution in the packet prepared for prospective residents.
Before proceeding with the current document, may ask for it to be even better and more useful?
Some suggestions
Content and Format

* Front page might include a "splash screen"
* Text something like "Heritage on the Marina, Century Celebration, Julia Morgan Building, 1925-2025"
* See attached mockup (actual reprint to follow SF Heritage house style) 
* Would be nice to include link and phone numbers for  both organizations somewhere on the front page, perhaps QR codes as well.

Rights

* The reprint will be available as a PDF file
* Heritage on the Marina will have the right to republish the document at will

I look forward to you comments and suggestions for a great reprint and a showpiece for the celebration.

Julia Morgan Building Centenary Celebration
Hi Carolyn
Thank you for securing the landmark designation for the Julia Morgan Building. It's a timely and well-deserved recognition.
I hope you've received your invitation to the Heritage on the Marina event celebrating the Julia Morgan Building Centenary, and noticed that you'll be speaking about the historic landmark designation. ;-)
I’m scheduled to speak right after you on a few of Julia Morgan’s design elements. It would be great to discuss how we can cover our topics with minimal overlap and maximum impact.
Would you be open to meeting here for lunch, or perhaps we could have a Zoom call or phone chat?
Cheers,
Theo

Hi Julia
Thank you for your detailed and wonderful response! I particularly appreciate your taking the time to collect and send images of JM's blueprints for the building.
Please do commence the process of having all the the images images scanned and sent to me. I can supply my credit card details for the payment and any other details you may need.
Just from the images you prepared, I can see how much these drawings will help my research and with the process of preparing the centenary celebrations.
I am looking forward to receiving the images and to working with you on this project.
Cheers,
Theo
