Greeating A3 Visual

I am a resident of the Julia Morgan building you see above. The building -which houses  a retirement community - is celebrating its centenary in 2025. The current lighting sucks and almost nobody feels the difference between bad lighting and the many stunning possilities that could be achieved with good lighting.

I would like to discuss with you the possibility of a demo or temporary installation that could be used to wake my people up and show them what is possible. I would pay for this effort. Fingers crossed it would excite people enough to start a real fundraising effort for a state-of-the-art projection lighting system.
