Greetings A3 Visual team

I don't think I have actually experience any of your efforts but your web site looks great and I am excited to see what you can do.

I am a resident of the Julia Morgan building you see above. The building - which houses a retirement community - is celebrating its centenary in 2025. The current lighting sucks but almost nobody here seems to feel the difference between bad lighting and the many stunning possibilities that could be achieved with some good imagination.

I would like to discuss with you the possibility of a demo or temporary installation that could be used to wake up my peeps and show them what is possible. I would pay for this effort myself. Fingers crossed it would excite people enough to start a real fundraising effort for a state-of-the-art projection lighting system.

I would be please to start a dialog with you to discuss this further.

* The person or people to talk to
* Scope of the work for a starter project
* Scope of the work for a full project we envision
* Typical costs for such projects
* How long it would take to get a demo up and running

As and when we get to some understanding, I will introduce you to the building management and the residents association.

I look forward to hearing from you - and to being enlightened. ;-)

Cheers,

Theo
