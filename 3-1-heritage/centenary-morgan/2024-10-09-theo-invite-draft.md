We are excited to announce the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the historic Julia Morgan building, home to Heritage on the Marina, on March 27, 2025. This event will honor Julia Morgan, one of the 20th century&#39;s most significant architects, and commemorate the buildingâ€™s rich history, which has not only housed but also lovingly cared for so many residents over the years.

We invite you to witness the naming of the building as Julia Morgan Building. The event will feature a reception, a historical exhibit, and a special presentation by a renowned historian. We are also planning a special tribute to the residents who have called the building home over the years.

Your support will help us create an unforgettable experience while honoring the legacy of the Julia Morgan Building and supporting the residents who live within her walls. Please feel free to contact us for more details on how you can get involved.
