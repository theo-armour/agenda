# 2025-01-08 JM Building Centenary Meeting ~ Theo Armour


## My Deliverables for the Centenary Celebration

* Cookie Images
* Invites of significance
* Exhibit of Drawings
* Architectural Presentation

## Accomplishments

### Images for Cookies

* Front of House: Suggested image shown to Angie
* Tudor Rose: Looking for better drone photos

## Invites of significance

* I hope to see Woody LaBounty next week
* Will follow up on Tom King
* Perhaps one more person
* All of the above: if not enough room could be rain-checked to some future architecturally-oriented event

## Exhibit of Drawings

I have contacted:

* Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley
* Kennedy Library, Cal Poly
* San Francisco Historical Society
* San Francisco Public Library

Looks like there is a good possibility that Bancroft Library has copies of JM's drawings. I have asked for access.

Depending on the results, I may need help in preparing exhibition panels and/or projection slides. I will do my best to have the data by end of January.

## Architectural Presentation

* First practice run: Tour with Next Village on 24 January
* In contact with Dr Karen McNeil
* Will prepare a draft of a PDF handout to accompany the tour

## Goals

My personal gosals go beyond the March celbration and include the folowing

* Goal: Discover evidence that the Morgan Building was intended by Julia Morgan to be "The loveliest building in San Francisco", IE, that that roses we see are intended to be symbols of love
* Goal: Entry to National Registry of historic Places
* Goal: Establish the Morgan Building Wikipedia entry as a notable article
* Goal: Create a document of publishable quality that will be of interest to the general public regarding the Morgan Building
* Goal: ongoing in-house events low-key with interested parties The Institute of Classical Architecture, San Francisco branch of the AIA, San Francisco Historical Society and/or others

## Illumination Project

* Will cover this separately from Centenary

* In process of obtaining a quote from A3 for a similar project for the Morgan Building
