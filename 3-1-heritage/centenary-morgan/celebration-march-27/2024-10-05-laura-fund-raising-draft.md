## Comments on Laura's Sponsorship Letter Draft

* Briefly mention how the funds will be used beyond the event itself, to reassure sponsors that their contribution will have a lasting impact.
* Consider incorporating design elements that reflect the architectural style of Julia Morgan or the building itself. This could make the letter more visually appealing and reinforce the historical theme.
* While the sponsorship levels are clear, the letter lacks a strong, specific call to action. Add a clear next step, such as "To become a sponsor, please contact [name] at [phone/email] by [date]."

## Other Considerations

* Total number may be only 130 people
* The celebration may be a naming opportunity" The Julia Morgan Building"
* Consider multiple activities and events to attract a wider audience and different types of donors: Social donors and architectural donors are two examples ov different constituencies.


## Possible uses

* Becoming registered for the National Register of Historic Places, is a complex process that requires a lot of time and money. The funds raised could be used to cover the costs associated with this designation.
* Building illumination is a great way to highlight the architectural features of the building and attract more visitors. The funds could be used to install lighting fixtures that enhance the building's beauty and historical significance.
* Creating a video tour of the building could help raise awareness and interest in the Morgan building. The funds could be used to hire a professional videographer and editor to produce a high-quality video that showcases the building's history and unique features.
