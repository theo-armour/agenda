## My Deliverables for the Centenary Celebration

* Cookie Images
* Invites of significance
* Exhibit of Drawings
* Architectural Presentation

So far, the accomplishments have been mixed.

Nonetheless things are being accomplished, as listed below.

## Text for Plaque

Mary asked me to draft the text for the plaque to be placed on the facade of the building facing the Laguna Street. I have submitted the text for review.

>Julia Morgan Building
>
>3400 Laguna Street
>
>Commissioned by the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, this <s>Tudor</s> Jacobean Revival building was designed by Julia Morgan, the renowned AIA Gold Medal-winning architect, and opened its doors in 1925.
>
>Constructed with reinforced concrete for earthquake resilience, the structure showcases a blend of brick, terracotta, and slate, adorned with Tudor rose motifs that symbolize love and protection.
>
>Today, as Heritage on the Marina, the premises serves as a retirement community for the elderly. With its expansive gardens and timeless design, it continues to embody its historic legacy of charitability and architectural significance, offering a serene and graceful setting for residents and team members.

I have offered to sponsor the payment for the plaque.


## Scans of Julia Morgan Drawings

I ordered, paid for and have taken delivery of the scans of the 24 Julia Morgan drawings of the "San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society Building".

I am pleased to report that the drawings appear to confirm my conjecture that the roses on the building are indeed Tudor roses and are a specific design element of the building as a Julia Morgan intention.

I plan to work out suitable methods for projecting these drawings at the centenary celebration and whenever desired.



## San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society Wikipedia Entry

After a gestation period of several years, I have finally completed the article on the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society. I will submit it to the Wikipedia editors for review. Here are the links and QR code for the article:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Ladies_Protection_and_Relief_Society#Julia_Morgan_Building_%281925%E2%80%93present%29
* https://w.wiki/D3ya

There is much more that can be added to the article, but I believe it is a good start.In particular much more could be added about the advocacy of women's right.

A surprise for me was the long-standing practice of engaging dome of the finest architecture firms in the city to design the numerous structure the society has built over the years.
