Dear Laura, Cindy, and Michele and Randy

On Wednesday, there is a meeting of the Morgan Centenary Committee. The focus of the meeting is to review the progress of the centenary party and its focus on community relations with residents, staff, directors, politicians, the press, and the public.

My message here is to raise awareness of other communities that may be interested in the centenary efforts including architects, historians, preservationists, and academics.

I am writing to just the four of you because trying to address both communities at the same meeting is not a good recipe for success. The two communities have different goals, different languages, and different ways of working.

I am in the process of preparing a separate message to the other community. I have already shared the draft with Laura and am now sharing with all four of you.

I am  reticent with sharing the document more widely because I am not sure how it will be received. I am not sure if it is too academic, too practical, too theoretical, or too applied.

And the last thing I want to do is add an extra burden to the already over-loaded exec staff.

I hope that you will be abe to skim through it and give me some feedback. Also Laura and I are planning to meet on October 5. Perhaps we can discuss it then.

Cheers,

Theo
