Commissioned by the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, this Jacobean Revival building was designed by Julia Morgan, the renowned AIA Gold Medal-winning architect, and opened its doors in 1925.

Constructed with reinforced concrete for earthquake resilience, the structure showcases a blend of brick, terracotta, and slate, adorned with Tudor rose motifs that symbolize love and protection.

Today, as Heritage on the Marina, the premises serves as a retirement community for the elderly. With its expansive gardens and timeless design, it continues to embody its historic legacy of charitability and architectural significance, offering a serene and graceful setting for residents and team members.
