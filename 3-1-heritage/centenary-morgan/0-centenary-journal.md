Julia Morgan Building Centenary Celebration

Hi Carolyn

Thank you for securing the landmark designation for the Julia Morgan Building. It's a timely and well-deserved recognition.

I hope you've received your invitation to the Heritage on the Marina event celebrating the Julia Morgan Building Centenary, and noticed that you'll be speaking about the historic landmark designation. ;-)

I’m scheduled to speak right after you on a few of Julia Morgan’s design elements. It would be great to discuss how we can cover our topics with minimal overlap and maximum impact.

Would you be open to meeting here for lunch, or perhaps we could have a Zoom call or phone chat?

Cheers,

Theo

Hi Julia

Thank you for your detailed and wonderful response! I particularly appreciate your taking the time to collect and send images of JM's blueprints for the building.

Please do commence the process of having all the the images images scanned and sent to me. I can supply my credit card details for the payment and any other details you may need.

Just from the images you prepared, I can see how much these drawings will help my research and with the process of preparing the centenary celebrations.

I am looking forward to receiving the images and to working with you on this project.

Cheers,

Theo

Looking at your Julia Morgan Online Exhibit, I see you have nine photos of the building. Thank you for making these so readily available.
