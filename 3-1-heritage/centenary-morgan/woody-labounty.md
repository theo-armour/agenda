Hi Woody

Vision
Today was wonderful. Much as I adore living at Heritage on the Marina, it is very rare to be with someone who actually looks at examines they are seeing (architecturally ;-). And there you were at the south side of the Morgan building, just standing and thinking and examining the brickwork. Yay!

Links

Link to my scans of the structural engineers drawings:

All of these are on a website that I maintain from time to time that gets very occasional visits.

Ah! And, almost forgot, as promised here is the November Heritage Happenings:

What's Next
The date for the Julia Morgan Building Centenary is March 27 2025. You will be invited. Lurie, Stefani, Newsom(?) ditto. Feel free to suggest people of interest.

That event will be a people party thing, which is very nice. Nonetheless there is surely a coterie of peeps that have an actual design and architectural interest in this fair city—people who at various future times would enjoy a tour, a party, a gathering here. Being a transplant, I have few if any of this type of connections. Your online published efforts and your real world events are outstanding. I very much welcome your insights, observations and guidance.

Cheers,

Theo
