Hi Angie

I had lunch with Joe Morris and Anne today. He reports that he should have plenty of grass-fed beef available this fall.

If you are interested, I would be delighted to sponsor a second grass-fed beef Dining Services event. When you are ready, select a date and let Joe and me know. I suggest a date in September or later, so we can have an article in the Heritage Happenings.

Cheers,

Theo
