Hi Angie

Every Friday, Marty Nolan attends the Sacramento Seminar where he is the guest of honor. See https://www.sacsem.net/

A while ago the group raised a large fund in order to record Marty's many excellent stories. The work, carried out by the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley, is now complete and the recordings have been transcribed into a book. The Sacramento Seminar and the Library would like to present a copy of the book to Marty at a party in his honor.

Jon Rubin, Chair of the Sacramento Seminar and my long time friend, has asked me to help organize the party. He asked if the event could be held at Heritage on the Marina. I said I would ask.

Jon thinks that perhaps ten-to-fifteen people might attend from his side. He also said he would welcome Heritage residents to join the party.

Thinking out loud:

* 4:30 to 5:30 on a day of your choosing, perhaps in October
* Drinks and hors d'oeuvres provided by Dining Services in the style of one of our regular parties such as the monthly birthday party or when there is a special event such as a musical performer.
* The party would be in the Morgan Parlor
* Chairs and microphone needed

If you think something like this is possible, I will ask Mary if she if OK with this before proceeding.

Cheers,

Theo
