# Scanning Project

## 2025-02-19
Hi Bob

The Stucky Library is the repository of numerous significant documents relating to the history of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society. These include the minutes of Board of Directors meetings going dating over a hundred years.

Tom King has recently acquired a high-end document scanner. Tom and I are planning a project to digitize these documents in order to archive and preserve them. We need a temporary space to make this happen.

Would it be possible for us to set up a scanning table in Flora's apartment (#238)?
