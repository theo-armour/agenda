# Angie Menu Retrospective

Hi Angie

As we discussed it would be a fun thing to include a Dining Service menu art retrospective in an upcoming issue of the Heritage Happenings.
Here's an idea: A page with one menu for every month of the year arranged in three columns and four rows.
If you like this idea, could you pick out twelve menus from last year? Or whatever twelve you like? They can be PDFs or whatever format you use. I can do all the shrinking and laying out.
There's no deadline on this. Please make the effort as and when you have time (which I imagine is not that often ;-)
Cheers,
Theo

Here's an improved version of the message:

Dear Angie,

I hope this email finds you well. Following up on our discussion about including a Dining Service menu art retrospective in an upcoming issue of *Heritage Happenings*, I'd like to propose the following idea:

A full-page spread featuring one menu for each month of the year, arranged in a 3x4 grid layout. This visual representation would showcase the variety and evolution of yur menu designs throughout the year.

If this concept appeals to you, would you be able to select twelve representative menus from the past year (or any twelve that you feel best highlight dining service)? The file format isn't crucial - PDFs or your standard format will work fine. I'm happy to handle the resizing and layout work.

Please note that there's no immediate deadline for this project. I understand your schedule is likely quite full, so feel free to work on this when your time permits.

I look forward to your thoughts on this idea. If you have any questions or alternative suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Best regards,
Theo
