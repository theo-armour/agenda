Janet was taking you on a tour during one of your first visits here. You were passing through the "Tony Lawrence Gallery" in the second floor corridor. My apartment is there and my door is always open.

You noticed the view out my window and inquired whether you might have a closer look. I agreed; you entered; had a look at the Cottage and Fort Mason; we chatted for a minute or two.

HotM hearts peeps who are warm and friendly!

My home is just a run of the mill continuing care facility. Or is it? I have no experience to compare.

What I do know is that HR goes out of its way to hire sociable staff.

The servers know your name, which walker or cane is yours, tea or coffee, prunes or not for everyone - in the house. With fewer than a hundred residents this is doable. (Even better: we know all their names.)

Housekeeping knows how to make the bed the way you want it made week-in and week-out, talk about grandchildren, life in the Mission. They take the time just to chat with residents.

Assisted living staff comb people's hair, suffer comments I could not. They do all manner of things I could never do.

It's not perfect, there are many issues - and some aspects at HotM are unbelievably nice.

I find the mix fascinating. I hope you do too.
