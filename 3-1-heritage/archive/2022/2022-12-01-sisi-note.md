Dear Daniel & Claude

I love reading anything to do about France. And, of course, when I read about France I think about both of you and all your family.

I feel I must do do something when I do this, so I cut out articles from the newspaper.

And I keep them, always thinking of you.

Now I feel I must send these clippings to you. These pieces of paper are two things:

1. They are symbol of my very fond recollections of our time together

2. I hope they can an inspiration for your grandchildren to think in an international way
