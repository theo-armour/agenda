# Eleanor Burke

Eleanor wore her heart on her sleave. You always knew what she liked and what she disliked. The best basketball team ever: Stanford Women. The best food: Vietnamese. The friendliest country after WW II: Germany. The worst baseball club: LA Dodgers. The most fun game: bridge. There was one joy I was particularly happy to share - the maker of  the best artisan chocolate bonbons: Christopher Elbow. And then there is the reason I am here: Eleanor liked Heritage!
