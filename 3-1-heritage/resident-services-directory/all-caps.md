# all caps

Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with your question. üòä

Using all caps in document headers is a matter of style and preference, but there are some general guidelines and considerations to keep in mind.

- All caps text can be **harder to read** and **slower to process** than text in sentence case or title case¬π¬≤. This can affect the legibility and accessibility of your document for different readers.
- All caps text can also be **mistaken for abbreviations** by some assistive technologies, such as screen readers¬π. For example, the word "US" in "CONTACT US" might be read as "United States" instead of "us".
- If you use a style to format your headings in all caps, rather than typing them in all caps directly, you can avoid some of these problems. For example, you can use the **Case** option in the **Basic Character Formats** panel in InDesign¬π, or the **All caps** option in the **Font** dialogue box in Word¬≤. This way, your headings will appear in all caps on the page, but not in the table of contents or bookmarks, where they might be less readable¬π¬≤.
- Different style guides may have different rules or recommendations for using all caps in document headers. For example, APA Style uses title case for titles of works and headings within works, and does not recommend using all caps‚Åµ. You should check the style guide that is relevant for your document type and audience before deciding on using all caps.

In summary, using all caps in document headers is not wrong, but it may not be the best choice for readability, accessibility, and consistency. You should consider the purpose, audience, and format of your document, and follow the appropriate style guide if applicable. I hope this helps. üòä
