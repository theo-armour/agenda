# 2025-05-05 ~ Excitement in the Neighborhood

_Suggested topics: neighborhood and excitement_

In 2020, after being locked in my 20th floor apartment for six months, I finally moved into Heritage on the Marina — my first new neighborhood in twenty years. At first, just as I had done at my old place, I walked the halls. Gradually I began to meet my neighbor -— blurry feelings of personalities and capabilities at first gently then strongly came into focus. After a while, I found that it was just as easy to go outside for a walk. Gradually the streets , the gardens and even trees and landscape came into focus as neighbors.

As the days went by, I walked further and further. It turned out that there were parklets where I could sit and read and have a coffee. After a while I could recognized that the baristas and bartenders were my neighbors too.

As the virus lockdown started easing, we are eating in the dining room. I got to know the dining staff, the housekeepers, the maintenance staff, the security staff and the management. They were all my neighbors too.

At my safeway, because I always go at the same time, I got to know that Rita is my preferred cashier and that Jesse and Robert are friendly stockers. They were my neighbors too.

As the things progressed, I ended up joining a political group that meets on Friday, they live all over the Bay Area. I got to know that they are my neighbors too.

It's time to wrap up, but with more time I could describe a half a dozen more groups of people that I have met and who are my neighbors.

What I still have not figured out is how this compares with all my neighbors who live online. My family, my classmate, my caregivers, my techie colleagues and all the people I chat and Zoom with. Are they all my neighbors too?

We live in exciting times!

In many ways, this text is more about discovery than it is about excitement. But then again, why can't a bunch of discoveries become something exciting? Discovering that you can discover must be exciting.

### Examples

Each of the examples I provide seems a bit dry and technical. It would be nice to add a snippet about something in particular that I discovered.

For example: Doris and Margaret, two women in their mid-90s — Women old enough to be my mother — Were to become my best friends.

### >We live in exciting times!

Ending quite abrupt.

## My Feelings

I do a ton of writing. Do I really need to attend a writing workshop?

Most of my writing is highly labored, research-intensive, edited multiple times.

This workshop is about 20 minutes of furious typing.

As English people might say, a change is as good as a rest.


## Writing

Yikes! Katie wants me to write about whatever. OMG: the blank sheet of paper!

My to do list is not relevant. My hope and aspirations are way to complex to summarize in a few minutes. I must become Colette or Proust and just go for stream of consciousness. I can just write and write whatever words come into my brain. The only distraction is the spell checker and grammar police popping up with instructions that must be obeyed. And then there is the stillness of my fellow iters and the utterances of the assisted living folds nearby.

How am I doing? Well the words seem to be coming out. So, perhaps I can recap some of the thing that Katie talked about. One of the things that struck me is that Katie had gone over the notebooks and my email and recapitulated what we had written about. Stories lke Anne remembering being a tomboy and Martha Nell's relative telling stories to a child in hospital every day are engaging and edifying narratives — even parables. And these reiterate my own feelings and desires that these are stories that are worth preserving and adding to the world body of knowledge and storehouse of good things.

How am I doing? Well, one of the things Katie suggested was going over ("double-clicking") into a previous writing. That is what I mostly always do. Perfecting, making things even better. Sisyphusean tasks, mostly. ;-)

The gig with Katie is different. It is about starting here and finishing here. This writing must stand her on its own twe feet. So far its going well. I certainly could pull up more thought about our introductory chat, but — looking at the clock —
time is running out and I must start to consider the closing?

I am a big fan of the surprise like sentence. Was that the writer O'Henry;s famouse thing

Ah, Ive got it! lucky me! I've written the final sentence before I have actually finished. So I can keep waffling until thins writing period is over. Katie has just left the room. Um, this means that brain must keep spewing so more. OK, brain. what have go to say for yourself? And that is a fascinating thing. Thew screws have come loose in my brain. And anything goes.

The End.
