# 2025-05-05 ~ Excitement in the Neighborhood

_Suggested topics: neighborhood and excitement_

In 2020, after being locked in my 20th floor apartment for six months, I finally moved into Heritage on the Marina — my first new neighborhood in twenty years. At first, just as I had done at my old place, I walked the halls. Gradually I began to meet my neighbor -— blurry feelings of personalities and capabilities at first gently then strongly came into focus. After a while, I found that it was just as easy to go outside for a walk. Gradually the streets , the gardens and even trees and landscape came into focus as neighbors.

As the days went by, I walked further and further. It turned out that there were parklets where I could sit and read and have a coffee. After a while I could recognized that the baristas and bartenders were my neighbors too.

As the virus lockdown started easing, we are eating in the dining room. I got to know the dining staff, the housekeepers, the maintenance staff, the security staff and the management. They were all my neighbors too.

At my safeway, because I always go at the same time, I got to know that Rita is my preferred cashier and that Jesse and Robert are friendly stockers. They were my neighbors too.

As the things progressed, I ended up joining a political group that meets on Friday, they live all over the Bay Area. I got to know that they are my neighbors too.

It's time to wrap up, but with more time I could describe a half a dozen more groups of people that I have met and who are my neighbors.

What I still have not figured out is how this compares with all my neighbors who live online. My family, my classmate, my caregivers, my techie colleagues and all the people I chat and Zoom with. Are they all my neighbors too?

We live in exciting times!

In many ways, this text is more about discovery than it is about excitement. But then again, why can't a bunch of discoveries become something exciting? Discovering that you can discover must be exciting. 

### Examples

Each of the examples I provide seems a bit dry and technical. It would be nice to add a snippet about something in particular that I discovered. 

For example: Doris and Margaret, two women in their mid-90s — Women old enough to be my mother — Were to become my best friends. 

### >We live in exciting times!

Ending quite abrupt.

## My Feelings

I do a ton of writing. Do I really need to attend a writing workshop? 

Most of my writing is highly labored, research-intensive, edited multiple times. 

This workshop is about 20 minutes of furious typing. 

As English people might say, a change is as good as a rest.
