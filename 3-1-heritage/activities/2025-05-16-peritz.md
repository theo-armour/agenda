* consumption good
* economy still strong

Long Term

Exorbitant Privilege ~ jealousy

* US
* dollars stable
* Treasuries ~ required globally as safe assets
* Centrality
* 37 trillion dept
* breaking news: US Moody rating declines
* Moron's Premium: Liz Truss ~ loss of confidence due to dumb gov

Chinese Tariffs

* Chine #3
* But China #1 consumer goods
* 50s imports 3% ~ recent 17%
* Wages stagnant
* Prices increases in non-imported goods high ~ cheaper stuff important
* Unaffordabilty crises
* 40% evicted at least once
* 20% price increases coming
* Christmas difficult

Why?

* real concern
* we have lost concern
* effort to take back control
* loss of manufacturing jobs ~
* the jobs dispersed ~ Now jobs in five cities
* China has lost 20% manufacturing jobs ~ dark factories
* Re-industrialization will not bring back jobs
* manufacturing least value added jobs

Wolfgang Streeck

* democracy <> capitalism : equilibrium
* Now market more powerful
* How to take control back
* Patient policies
* Example iPhone: $800 but made in US $3K ++

Trump

* not in good graces
* acting symbolically

Outcomes

* Tried Trump but now worse so must change

Or

* Do more of it, more crazies
