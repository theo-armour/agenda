## Emotion word: Surprised

I have been instructed to write a few words about the word "surprised".

I was surprised about this task. I guess I should not have been, since we had no idea about what would happen in this workshop.

The thing is that I really don't like surprises. My life as an architect and computer programmer is so much about planning things so well that there are no surprises. Always be prepared for earthquakes, flood, bugs, crashes and whatever else can go wrong.

And it's a plan for a good thing happening — party, wedding, c=vacation I certainly wold rather be part of the planning than be surprised.

Well surprise! It comes to mind that actually what we don't like are the bad surprises, but we may delight with certain happy surprises.

What are those surprise surprises that are happy? Ah! somebody here just uttered the word, "creative". Yes, it's something like that.

Perhaps it's like what happens when you are doing "improv" theater — where a group of people are making up the dialog as they stand on the stge. The whole performance is about continuous surprises!

So me being a good planner, I must plan having a surprise in this piece I am writing write now.

So what will be my surprise? Well, ha ha, I think I should end this piece with the words: "Surprise! I have nothing more to say!"
