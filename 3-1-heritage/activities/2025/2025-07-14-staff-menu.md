Hello Mary, Ange, Sylvie, Martha, Front Office, Stephen, Roxana and Bob

The wine and cheese menu PDF for the Wednesday event is attached.

Front Office
I hope you will be able to

* Print out 21 or more copies of the menu for the table on Wednesday
* Display the event details on Community Apps and in the elevator

Stephen
I would be great if you can include the event in your mid-day announcements on Tuesday and Wednesday. The Champagne Cork will be popped at 3 pm sharp. So be there or be square!

Dining Service
I will be delivering the wine and cheese Tuesday after lunch.

Also note that the Founder and owner of La Fromagerie on Cheesenut Street, Dylan-Morgan Fraioli, will be stopping by for a brief chit-chat around 3:15 on Wednesday .
