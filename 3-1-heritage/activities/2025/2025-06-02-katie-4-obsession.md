# 2025-06-02 Katie #4 Obsession

Hm. Should the title of this writing be "obsession" or "obsessions"? Singular or Plural?

Singular is probably more appropriate or representative in that how could you be in more than one obsession at the same time. The obsessions would certainly get mad with each other.

And that provokes a thought: When one is being Being obsessed, for me anyway, brings a certain sense of calm. This is what I am doing. Put all all the other life issues aside. Live in this moment. And give this one thing your all!

Being obsessed provides clarity, simplicity, progress toward making something meaningful happen.

The issue is all the other things in life that are being put aside while the obsession is in process.

Of course, you still have the people you love, and food must be ingested and nature calls and whatever. Somehow they are diminished in some way, placed at some place further away.

Fortunately, perhaps unfortunately, my obsessions come and go. Or can be somewhat controlled or steered. For example, I am currently in the middle of an obsession and yet here I am taking the time to be in this writing "wokeshop" [miss-typing that made me smile]. But, heh heh, what am I writing about? Obsession, of course.

One of my heroes is Pablo Picasso. Why? Because he was incessantly and obsessively creative. And not only that he kept or sold all his various obsessions. He was an obsession hoarder. Icing on the cake, his obsessions were inevitably interesting or beautiful and sometimes both. Pablo had faults, but I find much to be admired in his life-long ability and wherewithal and acceptance for his obsession to create.

Like most normal people, my life cannot focus on obsession. It's complicated, etc. Yet, for me, from time to time,there is a time to obsess â€” to focus, to concentrate. Looking back over the decades, I find that these periods of obsession in my life are the moments that give me much of what have helped and even caused me evolve into the happy person I am today.
