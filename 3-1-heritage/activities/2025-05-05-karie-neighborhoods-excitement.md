# 2025-05-05 ~ Excitement in the Neighborhood

In 2020, after being locked in my 20t floor apartment for six months, I finally moved into Heritage on the Marina â€” my first new neighborhood in twenty years. At first, just as I had done at mu old place, I walked the halls. Gradually I began to meet my neighbor. blurry feelings of personalities and capabilities at first gently then strongly came into focus. After a while, I found that it was just as easy to go outside for a walk. Graduall the streets , the gardens and even trees and landscape came into focus as neighbors.

As the days went by, I walked further and further. It turned out that there were parklets where I could sit and read and have a coffee. After a while I could recognized that the baristas and bartenders were my neighbors too.

As the virus lockdown started easing, we are eating in the dining room. I got to know the dining staff, the housekeepers, the maintenance staff, the security staff and the management. They were all my neighbors too.

At my safeway, because I always go at the same time, I got to know that Rita is my preferred cashier and that Jesses and Robert are friendly stockers. They were my neighbors too.

As the things progressed, I ended up joing a political group that meets on Friday, they live all over the Bay Area. I got to know that they are my neighbors too.

It's time to wrap up, but with more time I could describe a half a dozen more groups of people that I have met and who are my neighbors.

What I still have not figured out is how this compares with all my neighbors who live online. My family, my classmate, my caregivers, my techie colleagues and all the people I chat and Zoom with. Are they all my neighbors too?

We live in exciting times!
