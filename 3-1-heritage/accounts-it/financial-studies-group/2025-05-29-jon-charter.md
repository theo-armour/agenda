# 2025-05-29 Jon Charter

Hello Jon 

Thank you for the informative and engaging Financial Study Group meeting this morning. I appreciate the effort you put into keeping us all informed about the latest developments in the Heritage on the Marina financial situation.

I am wondering if there is a charter or a set of guidelines that outlines the purpose and goals of the Financial Study Group. It would be helpful to have a clear understanding of what the group aims to achieve and how it plans to address the financial concerns of residents.

Cheers,

Theo
