## Preface

The centenary of the Julia Morgan building at 3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco, is an opportunity to celebrate the life and work of one of the most important architects of the 20th century.  There are also elements that can resonate with the draft HotM Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and the Strategic Plan.

This paper adds another lens to the centenary of the building - And that is the point of view of an architectural historian or preservationist.

There are a number of opportunities to engage the interest of historians, architectural critics and devotees of arts and crafts. In doing so, the centenary of the building might be used to raise awareness of the building and its history, and to raise funds for its preservation and maintenance.

This paper is a first look at various aspects of such a project and is intended to be a starting point for further research and discussion.


## Architectural History and Preservation

### People to Contact

Here is a first list of people and organizations that might have an architectural interest in the centenary of the Julia Morgan building:

* Dr Karen McNeil ~ Julia Morgan expert ~ See HotM webinar https://player.vimeo.com/video/776287564?dnt=1&app_id=122963
* Tom King ~ Chronicle Urban Design Critic (close friend of Marty Nolan)
* Tom Jones ~ Dean School of Architecture, CalPoly ~ Margaret Johnson's son-in-law
* UC Berkeley ~ https://ced.berkeley.edu/collections/morgan-julia
* CalPoly Kennedy Library ~ https://lib.calpoly.edu/search-and-find/collections-and-archives/architectural/julia-morgan/
* California Historical society
* AIA, San Francisco ~
* ICAA ~ Institute of Classical Architecture and Art ~ https://classicist-nocal.org/ ~ Major supporter of Julia Morgan

## Architecturally Themed Events

Any of the above people or organizations might be interested in participating in the following events:

* Tours
* Lectures
* Exhibitions
* Workshops


## Aspects to Consider

Apart from centenary-related events and activities, there are a number of other aspects to consider:

* Progressing the listing of the building on the National Register of Historic Places
* Developing and completing the Wikipedia entry on the building
* Preparing documentation and presentation materials for the California Historical Society and other interested bodies


## Funding Opportunities

As and when the HotM Strategic Plan is approved, there may be opportunities to develop funding for capital projects.

In the short term, various centenary-related projects might be eligible for funding and these might serve as an incubator for developing funding expertise useful later as the Strategic Plan gets into gear.

The following are some possible sources of funding:

### Lighting

Problem: The lighting of the outside of the build at night makes the Julia Morgan building look like an industrial wasteland.

Resolution: Architectural outdoor lighting should be installed to highlight the building's architectural features and make it look more inviting at night.

### Front Door

* Problem: Solid plate glass window and door are not in keeping with the Tudor many small windowpane style of the building.
* Resolution The door should be replaced with a more traditional style door with small windowpanes.  The window should be replaced with a more traditional style window with small windowpanes.


### Wrought Iron Fence

* Problem: the wrought iron fence at the front of the house on Laguna Street is rusting away
* Resolution: The fence should be replaced with a new wrought iron fence that is in keeping with the style of the house.


### Other Opportunities

* Seating and tables for the gardens
* Updates to landscaping
* Documenting and cataloging the symbolism embedded in craftwork in the building

## Conclusion

Things I can do (time permitting)

* Draft a letter for sending to people and organizations on the list above to gauge interest in collaborating in the project
* Use the draft to contact and follow up with people and organizations on the list above
* Prepare further revisions of this paper as more information becomes available
