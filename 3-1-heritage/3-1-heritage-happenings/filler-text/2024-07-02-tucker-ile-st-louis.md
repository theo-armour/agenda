# Les Croissants de Burre

By Tucker Ingham

The escalators were "non marche pas" as we labored up two stories of stairs to place St Michel, emerging from the Art Nouveau gate on the bank gauche. Dragging our bags across un petit pont, we soon found ourselves surprisingly at home on the parvis of Notre Dame de Paris, more so perhaps than on Union Square via BART. As was typical, we had arrived in early morning to a Paris relatively solemn and nearly tranquil. Was that a bird chirping? The sublime towers of Our Lady seemed welcoming. We were happy to be there, enchanted, in the early 1970s.

At sunrise, one could alone walk up spiraling stairs to the south tower roof, unhindered by anyone, to enjoy the spectoral gargoyles staring menacingly down at the parvis. These great monstrosities, emphasized the message of the Last Judgment carved above the doors below: One must take responsibility for one's choice in life. C'est la vie.

Down the Seine, on the l'isle St Louis, rests a charming cafe whose windows gaze out on the east facade of Notre Dame and the ivy-draped walls of the ile de la cité. The Cathedral's sweeping flying buttresses reach like giant arms to the river on both sides.

As we munched into our café au lait chaude, the sun rose slowly revealing two large oval windows in the Cathedral's east wing which stared silently upstream, as if the entire Gothic edifice would one day depart.
