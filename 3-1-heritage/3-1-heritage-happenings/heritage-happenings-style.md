# *Heritage Happenings* Style Guidelines

Theo Armour ~ 2024-07-23

## Introduction

The following are some guidelines for submitting articles to the *Heritage Happenings* so that your content is easier to edit and publish.

The first rule is: submit your article - no matter what is looks like, no matter how it is formatted. We can take care of the rest. And we will share edits with you before publication.

If you do have time and the inclination, please submit text that is easy to edit and publish. You can can do this by keeping the format or look of the text as simple as possible.

## Mission

The *Heritage Happenings* is a monthly newsletter published by residents of Heritage on the Marina

* The format is intended to be as easy to read as possible for people with visual, cognitive and physical challenges
* The content is entirely created by residents of Heritage on the Marina. No clip art, no stock photos, no copy and paste from the Internet
* The content is intended to be of interest to residents of Heritage on the Marina


## Colors

<section style="background-color: #ff0;">

The house color for headers and other text accents

</section>

Brick red: #880000 or rgb(136, 0, 0)


## Dates

<section style="background-color: #ff0;">

We have opinions about dates:

* We like the European format for dates: 21 July 2024
* We do not like adding "st", "nd", "rd" or "th" to the date
* We do not like repeating the name of the month a lot: May 1, May 2, May 3, etc
* Perhaps we prefer 5/1,5/2, 5/3, etc

</section>

## Text Formatting

As simple as possible. Please do not use any of the following:

* No <u>underlines</u> ~ use *italics* or **bold** instead
* No ALL CAPS ~ use *italics* or **bold** instead
* No   double   spaces
* All text left justified
* No tabs or indents
* No embedded images


## Documents

Please send your articles as Microsoft Word files.

If the full full name is visible to you, the file name ends with .DOC, .DOCX or .RTF.

But no matter what you send, we can probably get it to work.

## Special Events Format

The Special Events entries all follow the same format::

1. Name of Participant: topic title or name ~ event title
2. Weekday, date (no "th") month at time ( x:yy format ) in location
3. Body text of a few lines

To the left of the entry is a small image. Please do supply a sample image. The priority of the images is as follows:

1. Photo of the presenter or performer
2. Photo of the topic
3. Logo of the organization

Example:

**Mary Linde, CEO: Town Hall Meeting**<br>
_Wednesday, 8 November at 10:30 in Friendship Hall_<br>
Meeting to address the issues raised at the Residents’ Council. Includes reports from executive and department directors.


## Movies Format

* **Date  *Title* ~ Year ~ Running time**
* Body text of a few lines
* Director: name ~ Stars: names

Example:

**November 3 ~ *Coco* ~  2017 ~ 1h 47m**<br>

## Images

Please send the largest highest quality images you have. The images will be resized and cropped to fit the format. The larger the image, the better the quality of the image in the final publication.

* Please send images as attachments to an email
* Please do not embed images in a document
* Please do not embed images in a PDF

## Tips

You can open Microsoft Word files on the web and also by using the Word desktop app. Unfortunately, files can display and print differently depending on the version. Currently, _Heritage Happenings_ files are edited using the desktop version. Use the desktop version otherwise you may screw up the format.

When you see text written in Latin starting with the words "Lorem ipsum", the text is a placeholder for text that will be replaced with the final text in the publication.

When you are working in a table, tabs have a special behavior. If you want to move to the next cell, use the Tab key. If you want to insert a tab character in the current cell, use Control or Command Tab.

Tabs in Calendar cells are used throughout the publication. Please do not use spaces in order to line up with tabbed items unless you have to,

Be very careful about copying text submitted by others. Most people are quite cavalier about the fonts they use and create documents with multiple random fonts. Use the Word feature to "Keep text only" or select the text and click "click all formatting".

<section style="background-color: #ff0;">

Remember to search for and replace double spaces with single spaces.
