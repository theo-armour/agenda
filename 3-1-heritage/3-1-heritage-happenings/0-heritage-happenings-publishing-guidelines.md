## Tips

You can open Microsoft Word files on the web and also by using the Word desktop app. Unfortunately, files can display and print differently depending on the version. Currently, _Heritage Happenings_ files are edited using the desktop version. Use the desktop version otherwise you may screw up the format.

When you see text written in Latin starting with the words "Lorem ipsum", the text is a placeholder for text that will be replaced with the final text in the publication.

When you are working in a table, tabs have a special behavior. If you want to move to the next cell, use the Tab key. If you want to insert a tab character in the current cell, use Control or Command Tab.

Tabs in Calendar cells are used throughout the publication. Please do not use spaces in order to line up with tabbed items unless you have to,

Be very careful about copying text submitted by others. Most people are quite cavalier about the fonts they use and create documents with multiple random fonts. Use the Word feature to "Keep text only" or select the text and click "click all formatting".


Remember to search for and replace double spaces with single spaces.
