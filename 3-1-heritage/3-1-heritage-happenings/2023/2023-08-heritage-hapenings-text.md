## hippa

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge.

When the HIPPA LAW went into effect, residents who became ill 'disappeared' from the community. Margaret Jacobs was concerned at this loss of contact with our friends and consulted with our then director, Marla Hastings. Marla sought legal assistance and our Advocacy program went into effect. It is a three stage process to sign up: 1. Choose a compatible resident to be your advocate. 2. Both must sign the Advocacy form. Keep a signed copy with your records. 3,Give a signed form to the Henderson Clinic to be put in your chart. Your advocate will learn from you how much or little you want to share. At best you have someone to call to step and fetch items from your room; make phone calls on request; and know you are being wished well in The Heritage As Community!
Add a copy of the Advocacy Form.

## Shirley

Meet Shirley Yawitz

Interviewing Shirley, it struck me that her story is the epitome of the American Dream: parents who emigrated from Poland and Russia, and worked hard to give their children opportunities. Her father owned a poultry store (she ate lots of chicken). Her parents were always encouraging, but she recalls that despite having an excellent education in both high school and college (Washington University in St. Louis) her parents did not believe the choice of Law as a profession was useful for a woman.
Shirley was born in St Louis in 1936, the oldest of three children (she had two brothers). She majored in economics, and was accepted into the law school at Washington University after her third year. But her need to find a wider world brought her to San Francisco where she found employment while taking a heavy load of four law classes at night at University of San Francisco, graduating after four grueling years. Then, as she graphically describes "the world started chasing me. " The fact that there were only three women in her class of 100 about 1970 brought the offer of many job opportunities.
Her first job was for the Federal District Court, then for an insurance company. She then made her most adventurous move – the decision to practice on her own which, she said, made a happy choice of profession go from good to better. "I really had a ball; it changed my entire personality! " Asked what she most enjoyed about her work, Shirley answered: "I think it was the way law is practiced, what we do when we practice law. What was so wonderful was the clarity, the logic, the interaction with people, the fact that it's so political that you have to be aware and know how things work or you can't make it work. " She also said, "I think the practice of law is applied psychology and that was the way I approached it; and everything seemed to flow from that."
Shirley became President of the Queen's Bench Bar Association, a non-profit voluntary association of women attorneys, judges and law students that seek to advance equality and opportunity for all women. She also became quarterly chairperson for The Commonwealth Club. The Club took her on a three-week cruise to Scandinavia and Russia which was wonderful, she said, although it cost her three-months loss in her practice.
Shirley became a probate referee, the person appointed by a judge to do appraisals of the property of people who pass away. She became President of the statewide Probate Referees Association. She then became Chair for the Northern California Standards and Ethics Committee which she describes as basically the district attorneys office for the probate referees "so we were on everybody's tail if they did anything wrong. Our interest was in keeping the process accountable: the process of helping the court to know what was in an estate and its value, so the court could handle it properly; and secondly to prevent fraud because we did independent appraisals. " Shirley gave up chairing this committee just this year in the interest of self-care. She continues as a probate referee, but has an assistant in training.
Asked about other interests she answered: "I don't think I have any other interests; I think my interest was my work really and truly; it took all my time and all my energy." Conversations with Shirley over the dinner table, however, have revealed a strong interest in food and nutrition.
You can find Shirley in Apartment 246 M. Her phone number is: (415) 929-6992, and her email is 76304.3634@compuserve.com.

## David Gruber

Is Jack your youngest?
Yes, and Elizabeth is my oldest. Elizabeth is my eldest, then Alfred in the middle, and Jack is the youngest. At one point not long ago, Elizabeth lived in London, Alfred was studying abroad in Australia, and Jack was in school in Texas, so having all three of my children back in San Francisco and available for Sunday dinners is a wonderful development. Admittedly, my now 2 – year old grandson Henry Maw, or Mini Maw as we refer to him, has taken more of the spotlight of late.

Gruber and Gruber Properties- is that the correct name?
Yes

How long in business?
Since 1974

Started by your Mother?
Started by my Dad. I joined my Dad in 1974. I also started working at CBRE (Caldwell Banker Real Estate) in 1979 in commercial real estate. I did both until I left CBRE to work for the family full time in 2003.

Are you the President of that company?
Yes. Head chef and bottle washer. Not accomplished without help from two of my children Elizabeth and Jack

How long have you served on the BOD of HotM?
23 years

How many years have you been Chair of the BOD?
(both terms) 7 years

What is it that draws you to the work of the H BOD today?
I joined the board because they needed someone with a background in real estate and became interested in helping in elder care.

Tell us about the experience of your Mother (Lydia?) living at the H.
Yes, Lydia Tiimus Gruber. The Heritage took very good care of her. But for an independent woman, being restricted in a living situation contrary to a very active life was a difficult transition.

How long did she stay at the H?
1.5 years over a 3-year period. There was a short time she spent in Oregon with her daughters Ruth and Esther.

Did she enjoy being at the H?
Because she had to leave her home, she never adapted completely to the new living situation. The most important part of her home was her garden which she missed very much

I remember, you came to pick her up every day for dinner at your home.
Yes. She would enjoy a glass of wine, a bagel with lox, and a spirited conversation with the nightly news on how she felt current affairs should be handled

What projects at the H, are you most proud of?
I enjoy being a member of the Facilities Committee. Along with the board, I received a wide spectrum of exposure to the inner workings of the organization. The acquisition of additional real estate contiguous to the current campus is an exciting opportunity to experience the implementation of the long-term growth plan of the Heritage. Watching and being a part of this campus’s expansion of independent living and assisted living all in one of the most beautiful districts in the city is truly unique

What is your wish for the future of the H?
Continue providing the best of services for the elder community

Just some general questions I like to ask friends:

Favorite book of all time? Adventures of Huckleberry Finn

Favorite movie of all time? Between Ford vs Ferrari, The Great Escape, and Laurence of Arabia

Favorite vacation? Lake Tahoe

Favorite thing to do on a Saturday? Golf

Most famous person you have ever met. George Shultz

## Murder at Claridge's  F
by Jim Eldridge
One of the Claridge's kitchen porters is found dead—strangled. Detective Chief Inspector Coburg has to find out exactly who he was, and what he was doing at Claridge's under a false identity. Coburg's job is complicated by the fact that so many of the hotel's residents are exiled European royalty. King George of Greece is registered as 'Mr. Brown' and even the Duke of Windsor is staying, though without Wallis Simpson. Clandestine affairs, furtive goings-on and conspiracies against the government: Coburg must tread very lightly indeed.
Set in London during WWII and bombing all around, this was a very interesting and twisted tale. This book is now in the Heritage library.


## An Interview With Jon Casey

By Doris Howard

Jon Casey, our still-new Chief Financial Officer, is a person with an impressive accumulation of skills and experience. He is a native of San Jose where he attended Archbishop Mitty High School and worked at Winchester Drive-in, making lots of popcorn and changing the marquee sign off of Highway 17.
Later, Jon worked for an electronic parts company where he learned about all the component parts that enabled him to become a logistics engineer. He then moved up to the position of Maintainability/Reliability Engineer with Kaiser Electronics and Aerospace. Jon explained how he contributed to the design of multiple “Head-Up” displays that provide information to jet pilots and astronauts. At this point, Jon realized he would need a degree in engineering to go further into design. He decided instead to return to business and earned a degree in business administration (with honors) at St. Mary's College in Moraga.
Jon moved to a billing and collection company that had proprietary software and was ultimately purchased by AT&T. After the break-up of AT&T, Jon became part of the team of the rollout of a new national resale program.
During his career he has been a founder or associated with various non-profits. One of these was called Community Cares. They worked to help other non-profits to find spaces to meet; spaces that were donated by other business entities. Community Cares made sure the spaces were cleaned up after meetings and handled all the scheduling. He also worked with Bay Area Center Stage, that staged plays written by local writers. Jon was also the lighting director for these productions. There were a few other non-profits that he helped found and was a part of.
Jon also worked for Episcopal Senior Communities for 16 years, which involved working on continuing care contracts and affordable senior housing. In 2008, he returned to St. Mary's to acquire an MBA in business administration, again with honors. Episcopal Communities became Covia Communities and later affiliated with Front Porch Communities and Services. Jon remained with them for two years before coming here.
The Casey family includes Jon, his wife Mia, their five children from past marriages and four grandchildren. The youngest son is in Ohio. One daughter lives in Montana with her three children. One son is in San Jose and another son lives in San Luis Obispo. Another daughter and her daughter currently live with Jon and Mia. Mia is the current Mayor of Hollister, her first time in public office. The family includes two dogs; Cora, a terrier mix and a six-month-old border collie named Cody.
The family lives in Hollister. Jon's drive to San Francisco takes up to four hours (two and a half on good days). He works on-line two days a week from home and three days here.
Among Jon's interests are painting and music. He paints landscapes in acrylic. He was a member of a group of four who had been playing music together in the 70s and early 80’s, mostly in small clubs. Jon composes songs and he plays the drums. When he isn't making music, painting, (or driving to work), Jon also writes. He has written three mystery novels, so far unpublished. He is presently working on a fourth.
As stated at the beginning, Jon Casey is a man with an impressive set of skills and experience. His business experience is matched in volume and complexity by his other cultural interests. To complete the picture, he is cordial, pleasant and articulate. We are fortunate to have him here.

## A Special Pair of Gloves

By Jane Standing

Way back in the 70’s after the famous ballerina Natalia Makarova had defected from Russia she met and married a San Francisco business man here in the city.
I was there to help my friend who was a Social Secretary making sure that everything went smoothly. I had worked with her before. We were in the back room and did not see any of the ceremony. It was a Russian wedding where the bridal couple process round the altar while crowns are being held over their heads.
Before the wedding a young man entered the back room in a morning suit obviously part of the wedding group. He was good looking, not too tall but with piercing hazel eyes. He was carrying a beautiful pair of dove grey suede gloves which he did not know what to do with. I took them from him and happily held them until he came to retrieve them. When he had gone my friend said “ Do you know who that was? It was. Mikhail Baryshnikov. He is going to be very famous in the ballet world”. And of course he was and still is though I don’t think he dances much any more. But I will never forget those mesmerizing eyes or those beautiful gloves.
