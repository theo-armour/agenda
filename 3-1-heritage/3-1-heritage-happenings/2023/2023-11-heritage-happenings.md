## ROOMS – INSTALLMENT 3
By Margaret Johnson and her son Tom

You may remember that the previous installment of this memoir left off at the point in mid-1944 when I left my bank job in Philadelphia for the excitement of New York City!
NEW YORK CITY (the first of 4 times!)
That was a major decision! I landed a job in New York with TWA airlines that started in September. So I went up to Vermont to stay for the summer with my sister Libby and her husband Karl in the tiny village of Moscow, near Stowe, to help with their new baby.
At that time TWA, like all the airlines, had their check-in desk in the Airlines Terminal on 42nd Street, across from Grand Central. The salary of $125 a month sounded like a lot after the $75 a month at the bank. But, as was pointed out to me when I announced my departure from the bank, it did not include the large free lunch five days a week that the bank had provided, and the rents in New York that were higher than in Philadelphia.
True enough -- but it was a lot more exciting!
Finding a room, let alone an apartment, in New York in 1944, as in every other big city at the time, was a major difficulty. My first thought when I arrived in Penn Station was to check with the Travelers' Aid desk, a service for all the displaced persons going through train stations in those days. I stood in line behind a young woman who had, I found as I eavesdropped, the same problem. She had come up from Washington, DC, and needed a room while she looked for an apartment. She had a job and would start work the next morning (hotels on short notice were impossible). The kind woman at the desk had NOTHING, except a room in a house in Forest Hills (Queens), which seemed to be a bit too expensive for the young woman alone. So, I stepped forward and offered to share it with her. I had been watching her and thought she looked okay – she was amazed, but so desperate she agreed.
Her name was Thelma Sussman (“Sussie”), from Gloversville, N.Y., and she proved to be a good friend. We took that room and later shared two others; all told, we lived together for over a year. She was a legal secretary who had made the mistake of having an affair with her married boss, a government lawyer in DC. A few years later Duncan (my husband – more later) and I went to Sussie’s wedding in The Little Church Around the Corner when we were living in Brooklyn.
After the room in Queens, Sussie and I shared a couple of apartments in Manhattan. The first one, on East 39th Street, was a basement apartment in what had been a beautiful Victorian brownstone full of wood paneling and parquet floors. We had a large room that had once been, I think, the dining-room. But by then the parquet was loose, the carpeting worn, the fireplace useless. But it worked for us, even with a two-burner hotplate and two cots, with the bathroom down the hall that we shared with other tenants. On rainy days I could almost get the whole way to work underground, through the tunnels and corridors of office buildings.
The second Manhattan apartment we shared was a summer rental far up Broadway in the west 90s. We shared it with two other girls; one of them, an Indian from a wealthy family in India, never shared the housekeeping work and clogged the drains in the bathroom with her long, thick hair.
Then, in the summer of 1945, I got engaged to Duncan, who proposed to me while on leave from the Army hospital in New Orleans for a few days. We planned to marry in November when he would have leave over Thanksgiving. So, I made a reservation at the hotel on Madison Avenue where he had proposed, for a couple of days of honeymoon after the wedding, and reservations on a flight to New Orleans (not too early in the morning, please) afterward, and left for Salem, where we would be married on the day after Thanksgiving
I had realized that I would probably be losing my job, now that the War was over and the men coming back. I had thought to solidify my place in TWA by moving to their headquarters in Kansas City, but New Orleans and Atlanta (Duncan’s home town) were much more appealing, so that was it for New York City (for now – the future would hold a lot more New York for me!)
Next time: coping with the chaos of travel, housing, and almost no money in the post-war years.



## My Uncle Al

By Dr Doris Howard
My youngest and most exciting uncle discovered bridge in the 1930s. He became a member of a group called "Culbertson's Men". This was Ely Culbertson, one of the founders of The American Contract Bridge League (ACBL). Al became the first and only national tournament director. Bridge became so popular that Al traveled nationally, internationally and on bridge cruises, managing tournaments. He taught my Aunt Helen how to play bridge (see September Happenings.)
He was also interested in humor and quiz games. He was a frequent contributor of quiz questions to a popular radio quiz program - Bob Hawk LEMAC Show (camel spelled backward - Camel cigarettes was the sponsor). Al also wrote a quiz book. He wrote a monthly column called Thirty Days for the ACBL national newsletter.
He was a witty and intelligent man who could control a room full of 100 bridge players; make snap decisions, run the show and leave them feeling they had a great time. He was a family man, too. With no children of his own, he paid attention to his nieces and nephews, sending picture postcards from foreign countries, and acknowledging birthdays. My sweetest memories of him are of the many times he took me out for dinner, beginning with my 16th birthday. In his last years, he and I lived directly across the street from each other in New York City which gave me the opportunity to take care for him. Perfect closure.

Bridge became so popular that Al traveled nationally, internationally and on bridge cruises, managing tournaments. He taught my Aunt Helen how to play bridge (see September Happenings.) At one national bridge tournament in Washington, DC, President Eisenhower appeared. Just another bridge player. We did get a couple of photos of the President with my uncle. Another frequent bridge player was Omar Sherif, with whom my uncle became a good friends.

## An Early Morning Tipple

By Jane Standing
The last time my daughter Sarah came to visit back in the Summer she was catching an early morning flight leaving New York at 7 am. She had completed a major accomplishment and to celebrate had treated herself to a nice bottle of red wine and had a glass each night. When it was time to go to the airport she did not want to pour the reminder down the sink or leave it there. So she found a container and took it with her. When her turn came at security the agent said “What is this?” She told him it was red wine. “Well it is more than three and a half ounces so you had better drink some”. A smart move on his part as if it had been something to blow up the plane she would have refused to drink it. To the the frustration and/or amusement of the line behind her she proceeded to do so. Then the agent said “That’s enough you can take the rest on board with you”

The remainder of the wine greatly enhanced her airline breakfast!


## Health Center—→Residential Care Facility For The Elderly

By Martha Nell Beatty

As we all know, in April of this year, Heritage on the Marina closed the Health Center
and continued with its Independent and Assisted Living options. For those frailer
residents who require more care, the Aging in Place model was developed and
implemented. Residents in Independent Living can receive a “visiting nurse” style of
care while they stay in the comfort of their home. Under this model they may receive a la carte services such as medication reminders, showers, dressing changes, grooming
assistance. If residents require more care than can be managed in this way, our
Assisted Living area is for residents who require two-person assistance, more frequent
checks, or who are dependent for all or most of their care.

Many of us wondered what the main differences are between a SNF (Skilled Nursing
Facility) and a RCFE (Residential Care Facility for the Elderly). As Jeff Brenner has
said, “A SNF is a nursing facility and a RCFE is not.” A RCFE can encompass Assisted
Living, Memory Care and Continuing Care. A RCFE is not required to have a nursing
staff. RCFEs are highly regulated with a robust body of laws and regulations designed
to promote resident independence to the greatest extent possible in a residential,
nonmedical setting.

Since HotM employs nurses around the clock, it is able to care for most residents who
would have otherwise been moved to the Health Center. It cannot,provide short term
rehabilitation under Medicare Part A. Most rehabilitation can be provided to residents in the comfort of their apartments or in the rehab gym under Medicare Part B. If residents do require a SNF for their rehabilitation, we have transfer agreements with Sequoia Senior Living and San Francisco Towers.

We all know about RNs LVNs and CNAs but don’t necessarily know the different skills
that are required for each category. They are:

RHSD (Resident Health Services Director): The RHSD is the Nursing Director of the
care team in the RCFE. This is a RN position. They ensure policies and procedures are
in place and are followed, they ensure regulatory compliance is maintained, and they
manage all of the LVNs and care staff. The RHSD directs care and ensures
assessments are completed timely, and that the medical record is maintained with
accuracy.

WELLNESS NURSE: The Wellness Nurse is an RN responsible for quality monitoring
and improvement, training and development of care staff, assisting the RHSD in
ensuring regulatory compliance, and maintaining records that are required for staff
development. They are often seen as the Assistant Director of Nursing.

RN (Registered Nurse): RNs are trained to assess a resident and develop a plan of
care based on that assessment. They are able to administer IVs, give onjections, give
medications, and care for wounds. They are also responsible for admissions
assessments and discharge planning. RNs have training in advanced assessment,
decision making, leadership, and diagnostic testing. It is the RNs responsibility to
oversee the LVNs and ensure residents receive appropriate care.

LVN (Licensed Vocational Nurse): LVNs can basically do everything an RN can do
except administer intravenous (IV) medications, IV nutrition, or IV blood products. LVNs are practical or technical nurses and are not trained in advanced assessment and
decision making. They can provide basic medical care under the supervision of an RN.

CNA (Certified Nursing Assistant): These are front-line nursing assistants and have the most contact with the residents. They help the residents with grooming, dressing in the morning, readying for bed in the evening. They also help with taking vital signs, feeding assistance as needed, and incontinence or toileting care. These caregivers are the eyes and ears on the staff. CNAs work under the supervision of both the RN and LVN and are trained to report any significant changes in resident activity or behavior to their supervisors.

## Aging in Place

With the closing of the Health Center, Heritage on the Marina has implemented a new program called "Aging in Place". The program is designed to provide care to residents who need more assistance than can be provided in Independent Living, but who do not need the level of care provided in Assisted Living. The program is designed to allow residents to remain in their apartments and receive care there.

For me the concept of "Aging in place" is much more than a program. It is a philosophy of life. It is a way of living that allows us to remain in community as we age. As disabled person who is a significant "fall risk", I understand that I will very likely be transferring to Assisted Living at a younger age than most residents.

Interestingly, I do not find the thought of yet another move in my life to be in any way troubling. There are several reasons why.

First, I have already done my downsizing by moving into Heritage.

In living here, I find that I have gained a large number of friends. I have also gained a large number of people who are willing to help me when I need it. I have also gained a large number of people who are willing to accept my help when they need it. I have gained a community. No matter where I live on this campus, I will still have my community.

In living here, I have established a variety of healthy routines. My diet is far healthier than it has ever been. My fitness level is as good as it has ever been. I have a variety of activities that I enjoy. I have a variety of activities that I am good at.

Sp for me Aging in Place does not mean that I will be living in my apartment until I die. It means that I will be living in my community until I die.



Meet Me in Monaco
by Hazel Gaynor

Back in September, a friend called to ask me to suggest a book that would “soothe” her jangling nerves. I suggested she read Meet Me in Monaco. This charming story strings together the lives of Sophie the French perfumer, James the British photographer and, of course, Grace, Her Serene Highness The Princess of Monaco and her wedding to
Rainier, His Serene Highness The Prince of Monaco.
The book begins with Grace Kelly, trying to evade a relentless and aggressive photographer, by diving into Sophie’s perfume shop to hide. The photographer is put off the trail as Grace is well hidden by Sophie.
While hiding, Grace becomes intrigued by Sophie’s special blends of fragrant perfumes.
The story continues to entwine these three main characters with the wedding and life of Grace and Ranier, Sophie’s struggles with her perfume business, and James’s family back in England. The book is based upon real people in the life of Princess Grace.
My friend did call me back to say she loved the book, as it made her smile and it soothed her jangling nerves!
This book can be found in the Stucky Library.
