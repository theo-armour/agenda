## Peter Skytte LVNM
Martha Nell Beatty
As an infant Peter was adopted by a family in a rural part of Chico, where he lived until his twenties. His adoptive parents had two biological children and another adopted child, younger than Peter. It was a blended, mixed race family.
In school, Peter was drawn to song and dance and found great pleasure in being a member of a band. He played a number of instruments with his favorites being oboe and clarinet. As Peter says, "Some people are just born doing music." He could compose his own harmonies and melodies and play them. But he couldn't put them on paper. In band he would simply memorize the music.
Peter was raised in a church where there weren't many children. He was always around his elders and was a natural at communicating with them. He felt he had a calling to to help them. He was always "doing his job before it was a real job"
He enrolled in a nursing program in a technical school in Redding, which was 13 months. It was tough because "you were learning on the fly." After studying the texts, they were allowed to practice on each other. Then it was on to two clinical settings. His first job in the field was in Grass Valley as a nursing assistant in a Skilled Nursing Facility.
San Francisco kept beckoning him from the valley cities. After moving to the city, where he now lives, Peter felt that this was a place he belongs. We first came to Heritage on the Marina through and agency. Thankfully, he is now on the staff.
Peter's long-term plan is to become a nurse practitioner. Peter is one of those lucky people who knew his calling early on. And let's hope that he is able to let music back into his life.


## My Aunt Irene Gallagher
My aunt was a bit of a character but was also interesting to me when I was growing up because of her work. She was the private secretary for about 25 years, to the owner of what became the largest music publishing company in New York City in the 1920s. Her work life centered on the musical theater.
Some of Irene's friends were the most popular composers of the time. She lived most of her adult life in a beautiful apartment just a few blocks above the theater district. She went to all of the opening nights of new plays on Broadway. Her apartment had personal photographs of actors and composers hanging on the walls. It was very glamorous to me and my sister. I recall seeing a beautiful picture of George Gershwin that was signed by his brother Ira (who wrote the lyrics to Gershwin's music). Ira Gershwin wrote: "George would have loved for you to have this." She always had amusing anecdotes about the music business and its stars. When Huddie Ledbetter - better known as "Lead Belly" - wrote his famous song: "Goodnight Irene", he dedicated it to my Aunt .
Irene was married to one of my uncles. The marriage lasted only a few years. Despite their divorce, she maintained close relationships with our family. Because musical theater was the center of her life, Irene's idea of entertaining us was to take us to an expensive restaurant, followed by the best musical of the season. I remember sitting in box seats in theaters and eating at restaurants where I was introduced to finger bowls.
She remained good friends with my uncle. She married and divorced twice more. Irene was extremely pretty; tall, black hair and blue eyes. The last thing I discovered about her was in a biography of Lorenz (Larry) Hart, the lyrics half of the song-writing team of Rogers and Hart. The last few sentences in the book described his death from pneumonia in a hospital in 1942. The last sentence in the book read: "Irene Gallagher called President Roosevelt to ask if the new drug Penicillin was available to save Hart's life. Roosevelt was unable to help."


## After the War
By Jane Standing

After the end of World War Two in Britain we were still critically short of food. I have eaten whale meat - double UGH - and reindeer - quite good - and lots of rabbit and corned beef Rationing did not completely end until 1954, two months before I was married. It was gradually eased and we were delighted as items were removed from the list. In the beginning to help matters the Ministry of Food put pig bins down the middle of the street to collect vegetable peeling and other scraps of food. They encouraged us with this ditty:-

Dearly Beloved Brethren is it not a sin
If when you peel potatoes you throw away the skin?
For the skin feeds the pigs
And the pigs feed you
Dearly Beloved Brethren is it not true.

A few years ago I wandered into a Second World War exhibition. I recited this and wrote it down so it could be included it in the exhibition.

## ROOMS – INSTALLMENT 4: NEW ORLEANS
By Margaret Johnson

In last month’s installment we left me ready to move with my new husband from New York City to New Orleans in late 1945, just after the War ended.

Marriage And Getting To New Orleans
Duncan and I were married in the Salem, NJ, Friends Meeting House on the day after Thanksgiving. He was a first-year medical student and a Private at an Army hospital in New Orleans. His flight from New Orleans was delayed by fog, so he came back by train. Although he sent me a telegram (a “Night Letter”) to say he would get into Philadelphia the morning of the wedding, we of course didn’t get it until that morning. My sister Libby and a friend drove to Philadelphia to get him, then we had a mad dash to get the marriage license, show him the venue and the arrangements, and get dressed for the wedding.
The wedding went OK, but if anything could go wrong after the ceremony, it did. The hotel in New York where we were to spend two nights (our honeymoon) before flying to New Orleans was overbooked, so they found us a room in a hotel on the upper West Side. The flight was on a tiny airplane (not the one I had booked) that broke down in Jacksonville, stranding us for several hours with no food – just coffee – while repairs were made. Duncan had an exam the next morning, so we had a nail-biter of a trip, finally getting in to New Orleans about 2 am.
Our first place was three good-sized, high-ceilinged rooms (including the bathroom, which was not originally meant to be such) in an old Victorian mansion at 1907 Esplanade, in the oldest part of the city. It was a flat on the second floor with bare lightbulbs hanging in the center, tatty curtains, and a kitchen made from the balcony outside. The large Morris chair that we sat in together many times was the apartment’s best feature; elsewhere an iron bedstead and a gas water heater in the bathroom (“geyser,” to the English), which sent steam out of even the cold faucets when we left it on one night when out to dinner with friends. I chalk up not burning the place down to Lady Luck!
New Orleans was incredibly buggy. That first morning I planned to make breakfast for Duncan before he went off to the exam, but the entire kitchen counter was swarming with small ants! Duncan just said, "Deal with it -- I have to go." So, I boiled water and dealt with it! Of course there were cockroaches and water bugs in Philadelphia and New York. But the cockroaches were small and didn’t fly at you when you tried to smack them and the water bugs were one inch long, not four. Only years later, in Iowa, did I encounter more numerous flying lifeforms, but never any larger than in New Orleans.
We moved as soon as I could find another place, to a new tract house at 6201 Warrington Drive, next to a levee out near Lake Pontchartrain. Moving to the outskirts was not great, but finding any place then was, with almost no money, nearly impossible. When it rained (so often!) the water rose under the house, bringing all the bugs up into the house. We had a real kitchen, but the bathroom was a bit odd: the tub was a walled off end of the room lined with tiles, because plumbing fixtures, especially tubs, were hard to come by during the War. It was large enough for both of us at once, which was fun, but the square corners were really hard to clean, especially as I got larger and larger in my pregnancy.
We bought just enough furniture to get by: a sofabed, a table and chairs, and, I think, a desk. We preferred to use our money on food, because New Orleans food was the best in the country.
On sunny days I loved sitting on the back steps reading and watching small lizards scuttle about. I got through a lot of Dos Passos and Russian novels. I would take clothing outside to air a little before scrambling to get them in before it rained AGAIN -- damp and mold were ever present. Duncan spent his days in medical classes, including anatomy. I once asked him to gut a chicken for me, but never again! He was so fascinated by its innards that I had to take it back or we would never have had dinner!
We ate out whenever we could, and on Saturdays a group of students and wives had a riotous lunch in an affordable-for-students restaurant in city center. We followed that with a supermarket visit, trying to get as many of the ¼ lb. allowances of still-rationed butter as we could. I really learned to cook in New Orleans and learned what a lot of well-known dishes should actually taste like. What food! A real eye-opener for both of us.
After winter and spring in New Orleans we spent the summer of 1946 in Atlanta with Duncan’s family, me hugely pregnant. Tom was born in late August, and Duncan left the next day for medical training in Brooklyn. I stayed in Atlanta until the spring of 1947 while Duncan tried to find a home for us in New York – we didn’t see him until Christmas.
But in the spring of 1947 it was back to New York City!

## A Really Terrible Evening
Martha Nell Beatty

I accepted with enthusiasm when I was invited to a "magical evening" given by the tourist boards of Dubai and Ahu Dhabi on November 15 from 6-9 in Sens Restaurant in Embarcadero Four. A few days before the event I read that there was going to be a major dinner hosted by President Biden at the Exploratorium, which is quite near the Embarcadero Center. There was a security zone which did not include the Center so I thought I would still plan on going.

I thought it might take more time to get there so started g at my Uber app early. But Uber kept saying that it estimated it would be about 20 minutes. After at least four roadblocks, it took an hour and ten minutes. At one point I received a call from Uber asking if everything was okay because the car hadn't moved in so long. And then the driver, who didn't speak much English, asked if I had any ideas. I arrived over an hour late for the dinner and was anxious, thirsty and hungry.

The private room was quite full when I arrived and someone was giving a talk. As I walked to a seat, I went by the bar. It had wine bottles and wine glasses out so I asked for a glass of wine. "No wine until 8:15 but we have water and lemonade" was the answer. I took my water and sat down not far from the buffet set up with tempting looking food. Then more people spoke and spoke and spoke abut the wonders of their Emirates. At 8:00pm there were fireworks, on the Bay for the dignataries at the Exploratorium. No we couldn't hear the speakers but still they went on. Until 8:30. Finally ime for wine and food.

My table was nearest the buffet as we were the latest arrivals. We rushed to the table and the lights went out. Nevertheless, we managed to put some now cold samosas, sliders, kabobs on our plates. By the time we sat the lights had gone back on.

And so the magical evening had consisted of 2-1/2 hours of water, lemonade and no food with a half hour of wine and food. There had been all the talks of the glories of various aspects of the two fabulously rich Emirates, which really do have a lot to commend them for tourists.


## Mosque in Abu Dhabi
Martha Nell Beatty

Although desert hospitality wasn't evident at the promised "magical evening❞ given by the tourist offices of Abu Dhabi and Dubai when you're in those Emirates it's a different story. In those Emirates, there is warm hospitality. There are some remarkable sights and experiences, some of which I enjoyed in 2009.

At the time I wrote:
"Our first stop in Abu Dhabi was to Sheikh Zayed's overwhelming beautiful Grand Mosque, the third largest in the world after those in Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. Those in the Kingdom can only be visited by Muslims so Abu Dhabi's is the grandest non-Muslims can visit. The Mosque, which holds 40,000 worshipers, claims to have the largest chandelier and the largest carpet in the world. To enter the Mosque, we had to don abayas (black robes) and hijabs (head covering), which were available for all visitors.
The blinding beauty of the marble-clad Mosque is similar to the Taj Mahal, but to me more majestic. Maybe it was because it was such a total surprise. Unlike the Taj, I had never seen an image of it previously.
The craftsmanship, materials, intricate details, the sheer size-all amazed. Yet with all its splendor and superlatives, it did not seem overdone.

The Museum of Ordinary People
By Mike Gayle NF 2023

Ever wonder what you will do with all the stuff you have accumulated? Perhaps you have already experienced downsizing and have had to make difficult decisions to toss or to find homes for various items in your household.

Our protagonist, Jess, has had to do this after the death of her mother. Disassembling an entire house full of her mother’s possessions is very difficult but necessary as she plans to move in with her fiancé. The fiancé has an extremely modern apartment with, really, no space for any of her or her mother’s treasures.

Jess finally works this huge project down to a set of outdated encyclopedias her Mother purchased for her when she was young. They had meant so much to Jess, so she simply cannot part with them. One day she finds a museum with a warehoused collection of ordinary objects. A worn-out work bench, an old wedding dress, all sorts of ordinary objects others treasured, but needed to get rid of, yet could not bear to dispose of.

This museum needs organizing and needs a curator….Jess.

What a warm and quirky story! No car crashes nor murders.
I hope you will enjoy reading this book. It will be in the Stucky library as of December 1st.
