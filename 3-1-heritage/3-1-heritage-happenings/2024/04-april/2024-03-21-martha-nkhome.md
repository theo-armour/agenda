Hi Martha,

For the April Heritage Happenings newsletter I will be continuing to write about Aging in Place. This month I plan to discuss "levels of service". I would like to include a list of typical items that might be found at each level.

I do understand that the levels of service can vary greatly from one community to another and from one resident to another. I would like to focus on the services that are typical at Heritage on the Marina. For each level there might a list of three or so items that are typical. There might also be a note that each level may include items form the lower levels.

A priority to to write in a simple, clear and non-worrisome manner. My articles run about 250 words, so very basic information will do. It will probably take a number of edits before we get it right for the newsletter and you and Christina.
;-)

I know that you have a lot of experience in this area and I will appreciate your help.

Theo
