## Residents Council

The March Madness fund raiser is off to a good start and there are still squares that are available to buy.

The winner of the pool will depend on the result of the final game and its scores.

The final will be played sometime in early April and we will be able to declare a winner.

You can buy squares for friends and relatives. You don't just have to buy squares for yourself.

However you can't buy squares for staff members.

We are also planning a tea to be held in the Morgan Parlor. This will be an elegant affair like last year. Champagne will be served. The date of the Tea will be the afternoon of May 23 and tickets will go on sale in mid April. Owing to spacing there will only be 40 places available.

Sincerely

Patrick Alexander

President Residents' Council.

HaHa, Yes, I felt overwhelmed when I found that file too.  But I'm sorry, that was so long ago, and as an 88 year old senior, I have lost specific memory of those islands.  I do remember going from Israel to one of the islands, it was a two night trip, and to save money I went "deck class" - I slept on the hard wooden deck with no blankets!
I was travelling the world on $5-$6 a day for two years length at a time!  I remember in Greece it was full of ancient Roman ruins (genuine ones).  They have Roman ruins too all along the northern coast of Africa!!

Just pick the best ruins and feature them, and casually attach an island name to
them, as I don't think anyone here at the Heritage has seen them all as I did.
Going around the islands was absolute fun, as tourists and local people con-
gregate at the coastline where there are clusters of bars and restaurants, at 5 o'clock every night and take a table and stay there all evening, until 10 or 11pm, drinking sake mostly.
I got addicted to ouzo, I had to have it every day, starting at 5pm!
I still tell everyone that to have a really good time, travel to the Greek Islands!

My favorite islands were  (if I remember correctly) Santorini and Mykonos.  They
have large daily ferries that travel between the islands, and when you get off
at the island of your choice, all the housekeepers with rooms to rent congregate
on the pier and hold up photos of the rooms they have to rent, sometimes
including breakfast if I recall.  So you barter with them.  They were cheap too
in those days, probably $5 a day!

Golden Gate National Recreation Area

1972 - October 27 - President Nixon signed “An Act to Establish the Golden Gate National Recreation Area,” (Public Law 92-589 introduced by Rep Phillip Burton), which established the GGNRA. Bill allocated $61,610,000 for land acquisition and $58,000,000 for development.

The Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the nation's largest national park in an urban area, encompasses nearly 81,000 acres. Spanning Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo Counties, Golden Gate National Recreation Area also includes areas such as Alcatraz Island, Muir Woods National Monument, Fort Point National Historic Site, Presidio of San Francisco, and the Marin Headlands.

Fort Mason, once an historic army post located at the edge of the San Francisco Bay, is the headquarters for both the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy.

Paved, accessible trails connect Fort Mason's upper and lower units. In between, the Great Meadow slopes down from upper Fort Mason to the Marina. These grassy hilltops and hollows are great for picnicking, sunbathing, walking, or sports activities. The meadow also offers wonderful views of San Francisco's hilly skyline and the Golden Gate Bridge.

There are many beaches to enjoy and explore in Golden Gate including Stinson Beach, Muir Beach, Tennessee Valley Beach, Rodeo Beach, Baker Beach and Ocean Beach.
