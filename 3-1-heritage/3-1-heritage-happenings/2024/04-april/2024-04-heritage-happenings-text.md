## Residents Council

The March Madness fund raiser is off to a good start and there are still squares that are available to buy.

The winner of the pool will depend on the result of the final game and its scores.

The final will be played sometime in early April and we will be able to declare a winner.

You can buy squares for friends and relatives. You don't just have to buy squares for yourself.

However you can't buy squares for staff members.

We are also planning a tea to be held in the Morgan Parlor. This will be an elegant affair like last year. Champagne will be served. The date of the Tea will be the afternoon of May 23 and tickets will go on sale in mid April. Owing to spacing there will only be 40 places available.


Sincerely



Patrick Alexander

President Residents' Council.
