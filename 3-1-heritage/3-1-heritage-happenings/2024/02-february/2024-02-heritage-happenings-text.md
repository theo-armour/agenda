After the War: from Parachutes to Petticoats

After the Second World War ended in August 1945 three things happened to change my life. I graduated from high school, we moved back to the London area and I started work.
I graduated from Luton High School for Girls. No big ceremonies as happens today. Just a visit to the Principle’s office and after a hug from her capacious arms and well wishes I was handed my School Leaving Certificate and with the paper in my hand I was out the door. That was it. I graduated early at fifteen and a half because I was promoted to a higher grade at some time in my high school career.
My parents and I moved from Dunstable where we had spent most of the war. Dunstable was an old market town about 35 miles North West of London and fairly quiet . We we spent a relatively happy time there in spite of wartime rationing, restrictions and frustrations. The Great North Road ran through Dunstable originally built by the Romans - very straight from the south to the north of England
My parents and I moved back to Old Bexley in Kent a small commuter town about twelve miles from the center of London. I began working in the bookkeeping department of an insurance company at 61 Threadneedle Street., next door to The Bank of England and close to the London Stock Exchange. The work was all done by hand with just an adding machine where you put in the numbers and pulled the handle, no computers to help like today. Being young the older girls took me under their wing and after a hot lunch provided by the company we would scurry out to the shops.
One of our excursions was to Petticoat Lane, a notorious market where you could get almost anything iThe saying was that they would steal your watch at one end and try to sell it back to you at the other! Clothing was still rationed so we bought many items on the Black Market there without having to use our precious clothing coupons. the girls bought me my first pair of nylon stockings. ( Did they fall off the boat from America? ) One day we found someone selling parachutes, Were they new or used ? They was new. So after a quick conference we decided to buy half of one. .When we got it back to the office we found that half of a parachute was HUGE! We divided it up. It was enough for us all to make underwear, blouses etc. We were so pleased with our purchase!. We made our garments and then we found out the problem Being very tightly woven nylon they did not breathe! We did not care, We wore them proudly even if they were a bit hot and did not breathe. We wore them for quite a few years delighted to have something pretty to wear after the drabness of the war.


Rooms Chapter 6 – My First Time In San Francisco
You may remember that the last installment of this memoir left off with our son Tom and baby daughter Elizabeth arriving at Oakland airport after a horrible airplane flight from Brooklyn, New York.
The Mission Street Rooms
Duncan had found an apartment at 5245 Mission Street, about as far away from downtown San Francisco as you can be and still be in the city – not too far from the Cow Palace. The apartment was much bigger than the one in Brooklyn. It was above a laundromat, with a backyard that we shared with the apartments next door that were above the adjacent Spudnuts shop (Spudnuts makes donuts out of potato flour and are still in business, although not at the Mission Street site). We had a lot of space to fill and not enough furniture to fill it, but, fortunately, the movers had left some packing cases – flimsy tea crates and cardboard barrels -- which made tables for us.
The families next door had children to play with ours, and a neighbor to take care of my children when I took a part time job in a department store before Christmas. The backyard was a great resource – a safe play area for the children and a place to hang laundry. Our third child, Anne, was born the first year we lived on Mission Street.
During this time, mid-1949 to early 1952, Duncan was an intern at San Francisco County Hospital, and actually did some of his work at the historic old Laguna Honda hospital.
Life In San Francisco In 1950
In San Francisco I had my first opportunity since getting married to earn a little money for myself. The owner of the Spudnut shop made a deal with me to make pies for him – for his personal pleasure, not to sell, although I think he did sell some of them. He was particularly fond of banana cream pies and lemon meringue. This is not a way to make money -- really, really labor-intensive!
San Francisco in those days was a fascinating place. Very different from back East and, of course, the beatnik movement was in full swing. Despite still having very little money, we were able to do a little exploring and eating out in this wonderful city.
On To Texas!
In 1952, Duncan was called back into the military for service during the Korean War and stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, then the well-known home to the Army’s tank corps. He was now a First Lieutenant in the Medical Service. As always, he went on ahead and the children and I followed later to Killeen, the base’s local town. I drove the three children to Killeen leaving a trail of wet bathmats that two-year-old Anne pulled into all the motel tubs along the way.
We can forget the rooms in the house in Killeen. The house, itself, at 1705 Cole Street in a bleak housing development, was totally forgettable. It was in the middle of a sunflower patch, with dark tile flooring that hid the scorpions that came out at night -- every sort of venomous wildlife lived with us. It was blazing hot in the summer (the local market, the Mini-Max, was so air conditioned that walking in and out of it was a physical shock) and there were no trees anywhere near the house. We lived there – an ordeal -- for the two years of Duncan’s military hitch. A recent Google search shows the house now with trees and a carport.
Tom attended the nearby school in Killeen, but Libby’s birthday came in October, too late for the schools in Killeen, so she and Anne went to a day care center on the base.
The day a tornado (they called them “twisters”) threatened the base, they called frantically for me to come get the kids but Duncan had the car, out at the far end of the base. He was able to get them home and the storm veered off, missing Fort Hood but almost destroying Waco.
The house I do remember with pleasure from that time was actually in the nearby town of Temple. The sergeant living next door to us in Killeen was able to rent it for his family. He, his Mexican wife, and their numerous children were crammed into a low-ceilinged white box just like our house. I can't remember how I got involved with their move, but I do remember loading the wife and what seemed like hordes of small, quiet, well-behaved children into my car and driving them over to the new home. It was a clean, though unpainted, clapboard house built up on blocks – no cellar - with lots of rooms for everyone, high ceilings, breezes, and trees. It had a yard to play in -- no grass, only packed earth, but they thought it wonderful. Such joy for them all! It looked to me, at the time, like a sharecropper's shanty but I could see how much better it was for them than the mingy little place in Killeen, and I was glad for them.
Next chapter: Anne nearly dies, we move back to New York.



1705 Cole Street, Killeen, TX, in 1953. Typical, bleak post-war boom housing.

What to Look for in the Garden in Feb.
By Margaret Missiaen

The Porter Garden behind the Perry Building was named for Julia Gorman Porter in the 1980’s. Porter was President of the Board of Lady Managers of the Crocker Old Peoples’ Home when it merged with the Heritage in the 1950’s.
Flowering now are Cymbidium orchids—brought by Lloyd and Marion Wake when they moved to the cottage at the Heritage in 1993. Lloyd divided and repotted the orchids many times before his death in 2017. The orchids were moved to the Porter Garden. (Reference photo 1.)
The camellias are also in full flower. There are different varieties of this shrub in the garden. Recent additions are pink-flowering camellias planted in memory of Eleanor Burke (photo 2) and Dominique Gasper (photo 3).
To view these flowers, take the steps toward the grassy center of the garden. On your right, you will see the small tree identified with a plaque. At the top of the steps, continue to the right to find the orchids. Walking toward Francisco St., turn right again see the cat statue and camellias given in memory of Dominique Gasper.


Astor: The Rise and Fall of an American Fortune by Anderson Cooper ~ 2023 ~ NF
By Trish Otstott
This is the incredible story of a family that squandered an enormous private fortune. Cooper wrote this book as a follow-up to Vanderbilt, which was his book about his own family and its lost fortune. Astor begins with the end, as Brooke Aster and Gloria Vanderbilt, each seated at her own number one table at Mortimer’s in New York City, reign as the last queens of the tail end of the Golden Age.
The Astor fortune was established by John Jacob Astor with his slaughtering of thousands of beavers for their precious pelts. The fortune evaporates because of an excess of everything. Over the generations, various Astors built huge five and six story mansions, owned several lavish yachts and spent vast sums of money while traveling the globe for pleasure, acquiring rare antiques along the way. The last little bits of the Astor fortune were then fought over by Brooke Astor and her son who was not even an Astor at all.
I thought this book was interesting and I particularly enjoyed understanding how this famous family and its famous fortune fit into our country’s history. From the Waldorf Astoria in New York City to the sinking of the Titanic, this family left its mark in so many ways.
I delivered this book to HotM last week. Hope you enjoy it.

## Sylvie

Sylvie Holdmam ~ Executive Chef ~ An update
By Martha Nell Beatty
The beginning of 2024 Sylvie stepped into the role of executive chef after serving as sous chef under Kevin for three years. She is starting with a complete team in the kitchen with two new hires as cooks.
Each year there are two sets of menus that repeat every four weeks. They originate from Morrison, but individual chefs then create their own menus with recipes that are on a massive Morrison date base Sylvie is currently working with the fall/winter menus that were set up by Kevin. But soon she will be planning the spring/summer set.
Now Sylvie has less concerns about following the strict guidelines that the
kitchen had to follow when the Health Center was open. Previously, it was required that the dietician approve every menu adhering to very strict standards. Of course, there are still guidelines to follow. There is aways a consideration for such things as sodium levels and fat content.
Sylvie is excited about the Around the World menus that she will create this year. The third Friday every month there will be a focus on a specific country with entertainment typical of that country. We’ve already had Italian night and, as always, in February, there will be a Chinese New Year dinner. Katie Loo will do her usual by bringing dim sum and desserts. February will also see another Morrison special evening with Mardi Gras.
We have had some of the twelve cuisines over the years but never every month. In 2024, new countries to be featured include India. Thailand and El Salvador. What will be missing this year is Japan.
We are pleased that Sylvie was promoted to executive chef and know we have many good meals ahead of us.

## Aging in Place

From time-to-time residents hear about “levels of service”. The term relates to fees that residents may be asked to pay above and beyond the regular monthly rent fee.
Please note: if you are a resident on the Type A Life Care Contract: you can skip to the next article! This topic does not apply to you.
If, however, you are on a Type C Continuing Care Contract then learning about “levels of services” may be useful to you.
As you age you may need help with daily activities such doing laundry, managing medications, or taking a shower. Typically, you are helped by a Certified Nursing Assistant (CAN) and Heritage charges you by the time and resources needed.
If you need assistance only on odd occasions, the services are charged individually. If, however, you need help on a regular basis for a number of activities then this is where the levels of service comes in.
In essence its like a “frequent flier” discount. The more you require help the better the discount. There are four levels of service ranging from just a moderate amount of help to needing help for almost everything. The price you pay will be the cheaper of whether services paid individually or paid in bulk with a level of service agreement.
It is worth noting that the levels of service are loosely defined. You needs are highly individual. Levels of service are agreed by you, your primary care givers and team members. More on levels of service in future issues.

## Understanding "Levels of Service" in Aging in Place

Residents often encounter the term “levels of service,” particularly in the context of additional fees that may be incurred beyond the standard monthly rent.

Important Note: If you're a resident under the Type A Life Care Contract, feel free to move on to the next article, as this information does not pertain to you.

For those with a Type C Continuing Care Contract, gaining an understanding of “levels of services” is beneficial. As aging progresses, various daily activities like laundry, medication management, or showering might require assistance. This support is typically provided by a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA), with Heritage determining charges based on the time and resources utilized.

Service charges are structured in two ways: For sporadic assistance needs, services are billed individually. However, if you find yourself requiring regular support for multiple activities, this is where the concept of levels of service becomes relevant. Think of it as a “frequent flier” discount: the more assistance you need, the greater the discount. The service levels are categorized into four tiers, ranging from minimal assistance to comprehensive support. Billing is calculated to ensure cost-effectiveness, comparing individual service charges versus a bundled rate under a level of service agreement.

It's crucial to recognize that levels of service are tailored; your needs are unique. These service levels are determined collaboratively by you, your primary caregivers, and team members. We will delve deeper into the nuances of levels of service in future editions.
