De Young Docent Jim Kohn: American Beauty
Monday, 1 July at 3:00 in Friendship Hall
“American Beauty” w/
" American Beauty: The Osher Collection of American Art
celebrates one of the most transformative promised gifts
of art in the Museums’ history. Featuring works by many of
the United States’ foremost artists, the collection
assembled by Bernard and Barbro Osher spans the years
1848 to 1960 and reflects an array of artistic responses to
an exceptionally dynamic and complicated period in
American culture. The collection illustrates how American
artists have long sought to define and declare American
styles and subjects, and this debut exhibition will both
affirm and interrogate how a distinctly national art was
shaped both by its international influences and by its
regional character. Reflecting a multiplicity of voices and
perspectives, the Osher Collection will serve as a resource
for research, education, and public engagement, fostering
a deeper appreciation of the vast and evolving landscape
of American art— and its reflection of the American
experience."
