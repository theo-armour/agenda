Hi Jon

I am looking at the "2022-23 Pricing Sheet | Continuing Care Assisted Living" document that you sent me. I have a few questions about the services that are offered at each level of care

What are some typical examples of Continuing Care Assisted Living (AL) services that are offered at each level of care for IL residents? Do these include things like personal laundry, making beds daily, wake up calls and so on?

Are there currently any Independent Living (IL) residents who are receiving Continuing Care Assisted Living (AL) services in their IL apartments? If so, how many?
