Sonoma Valley Authors Festival 2024
Beginning Monday, June 3rd -Thursday June 13th
Friendship Hall at various times & days
Details on Authors/ Presenters will be sent in a separate email.
The Sonoma Valley Authors Festival is an annual 3-day weekend lecture series that brings people together to hear authors from a variety of literary genres. Using a “TED Talk” style format that includes “main tent” and breakout sessions, speakers discuss their latest works as well as advances being made in science, technology, medicine, and current issues. At a time when the art of listening seems to be disappearing, the need for civil discourse has never been greater. With so many voices vying for our attention, people are receptive to well-informed speakers and eager for thoughtful conversation and discussion of ideas. The Festival attracts people who are committed to lifelong learning; many are at a stage in life where experiences are of more value than things and they enjoy vacations with a purpose.

## Homa

Homa Goodzari
Massage and Healing


Twice a month, Homa Goodarzi comes to The Heritage to give massages in a designated room in the former Health Center. Her massages are a bit more---she provides healing at the same time. Once when I went to see Homa, I was seething from a conversation with someone who had been insolent (no one here). She calmed me down as she worked on the tight muscles in my shoulders. Homa calls what she does the therapeutic massage technique.

You know someone is good when you are delighted when you see the person’s name on your calendar.

Homa has sign up sheets outside the dining room.


Note: Most Tuesdays you can have a complementary hand massage in Friendship Hall at 1:30pm with Roxana.


## Cuba 2016 Martha Nell Beatty
Cuba ~ A brief interlude for tourists

Martha Nell Beatty

“Every magazine and newspaper travel section has had an article about Cuba this year Writers threw around adjectives like seductive, aging beauty, romantic, creative. They worry (rightly) about how the present infrastructure can handle the rapidly increasing interest in visiting the so-close island nation.“ This is what I wrote in 2016.

All the enthusiasm was because Cuba after 54 years of hostility between the US and Cuba, normalization of relations occurred under Obama. Tour companies scrambled to organize tours, cruise lines quickly added stops, and airlines Increased direct flights from. the US mostly from Florida. A friend and I signed up for one of those tours at the end March. We arrived in the third largest city in Cuba just as the Obama family arrived in Cuba. The last US President to visit Cuba had been Calvin Coolidge, 86 years before

Was Cuba ready for an influx of American tourists? For us, I can say mostly yes—except for one deplorable hotel and the nightmare at Havana’s airport.

 Hotels generally set the tone of a tour. We stayed in three hotels that were vastly different. The first was a “boutique” hotel in Camaguey on a busy square. The lobby and rooms were pleasant. The best part was the rooftop dining room. Here food was limited and service earnest and on the way to improvement. The hotel was certainly acceptable.

 Our second hotel was a seaside resort outside of Cienfuegos. I could only imagine what this hotel must have once been and what it could be. But it was barely acceptable. My room had a sea view with a private terrace, which was unkempt and had no furniture. I could only enjoy the view through dirty windows. The front desk was rude and its most used word was “no.” Thankfully, the only meal we had at the hotel was breakfast. Arriving in the dining room we found that someone had negated to turn on the machine that produced hot water for tea and coffee and so no hot drinks.

Our hotel in Havana was the Melia Cohiba, part of a Spanish chain and basically was first class. Again, our only meals here were breakfast and they were outstanding. The buffet breakfast was incredibly impressive. Eight kinds of fresh juices from cucumber to papaya, four kinds of yogurt drinks. Omelet station. Tons of fruit, pastries, meats, beans and rice. A mimosa was available for an extra price.

Dining outside the hotels was often a fun and unique experience. The meals we particularly enjoyed were in paladars—family run restaurants in their homes. We were served lots of fish and even lobster. The best was in Cientuegos, where the special treat at the end was three-year old rum accompanied with a cigar.

We had some first-rate experiences that gave us an insight into what Cuba offered: A walking tour of the old city, a UNESCO Heritage Site, with an architect. A vist to the company class of the Camaguey Ballet School. A special concert with Cuban musicians and a Russian conductor. A visit to the studio of the “Picasso of the Caribbean” Jose Fuster. Drives in the impeccable 1950’s convertibles.

The challenges were the fact that US credit cards were not accepted and our cash had to be changed into Cuban pesos. To make it more interesting in there are two currencies—one for nationals and one for tourists. Of course, the Cubans got better rates. As our guide said many times, “It’s complicado.”

Often it’s the departure from a place that we remember, if it is especially negative. We spent over seven hours at Havana’s Airport waiting for our charter flight on a Cuban airline, Xtra Airline. The information board was useless, the staff uninformed. There were a couple of places where you could buy, coffee, beer soft drink and sandwiches but no restaurants or bars. My friend needed a wheelchair to get to the plane. Since there were none, they took us in an ambulance. We were among the few who made our connections in Miami.

But then in 2019, Trump’s administration pulled the curtain down on tourist travel for Americans as well as curtailing American business dealings with the island. Suddenly, tour companies had to cancel their tours, cruise lines stopped their calls, airlines cut back on flights. Once again, Cuba, only 95 miles from Florida seemed like a distant land. Once again it has become elusive, enigmatic.
