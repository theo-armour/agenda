Originally from Germany, I studied and taught yoga for over 25 years.

I am deeply dedicated to facilitating holistic healing and certified as a yoga therapist in 2016. In this role, I specialize in supporting individuals facing mental or physical challenges by tailoring yoga practices to their unique conditions and needs.
Additionally, I was certified as a Stress Management Educator to empower individuals to cultivate resilience and inner peace through mindful practices. I am also a Shiatsu and Reiki Practitioner, modalities that complement the comprehensive approach to well-being fostered through yoga.
In 2022 I received my certification as a Brain Longevity Specialist by the Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation to deepen my understanding of mental health and how to prevent Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline.
