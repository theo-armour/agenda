June 2024: Heritage Happenings

Hello Heritage Residents

As part of the monthly **Around the World** program, _Heritage Happenings_ visits **The Caribbean**. Look for the trumpet player cameo and the green, black and c=gold colors of the Jamaican flag theme.

The issue also celebrates **Father's Day** with photos of many fathers of team members and residents.
