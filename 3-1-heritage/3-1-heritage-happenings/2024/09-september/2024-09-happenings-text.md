## Patrick: Notes to Theo for inclusion in the Heritage Happenings

I would like to thank all the people who called and emailed me when I had covid. It was very encouraging since you are confined to your apartment and do not have contact with anyone.

I have no idea how I contacted covid. I had visited Safeway some days before and also the post office, the library and Walgreens. So at any one of those places could have been a time that someone coughed behind me and passed on the disease.

While I was confined to my apartment some friends passed on some philosophical comments that I found amusing. I list them below.

~ Jean Kerr...
The only reason they say 'Women and children first' is to test the strength of the lifeboats.

~ Prince Philip...
When a man opens a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife.

 ~ Jean Rostand...
Kill one man and you're a murderer, kill a million and you're a conqueror.

~ Arnold Schwarzenegger...
Having more money doesn't make you happier. I have 50 million dollars but I'm just as happy as when I had 48 million.

~ WH Auden..
We are here on earth to do good unto others. What the others are here for, I have no idea.

~ Old Italian proverb...
After the game, the King and the pawn go into the same box.

~ Anonymous
There are only 3 things certain in life

* Death
* Taxes
* And Mattresses are always on sale.

Regards

Patrick
