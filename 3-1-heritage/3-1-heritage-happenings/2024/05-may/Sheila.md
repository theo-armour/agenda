it started to pour with rain and I walk through the small town seeking shelter. I saw a very inviting bar called Guillermo's which had an open veranda to the street, and a man was playing a guitar. so I sat on the veranda and ordered a margarita and waiting for the rain to stop. after the rain eased off I explored the little village on this aisle of Ela delanwhereas, and we startled to discover a fantasy Van Cleef and our pills jewelry store!! what a difference in her has for my first visit circuit 1979 when there was only a few narrow lanes and two restaurants with dirt floors! I find Mexico is more more prosperous than it used to be; no more beggars, and everything is nicer. I would not have recognized dealer from my previous visit.
