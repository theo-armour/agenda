David Furman: What Outer Space Can Teach Us About Aging
Wednesday, 1 May at 11:00 in Friendship Hall
Buck Institute Seminar #2: Zero gravity is not an anti-aging intervention. What we’re learning from astronauts who’ve done long term space travel can teach us a lot about how we age here on earth. And better yet, efforts to protect the health of space travelers will likely have payoffs here at home. Dr. Furman’s insights really are out of this world!

## What to Look for in the Gardens in May
By Margaret Missiaen

The garden at the corner of Laguna and Francisco is named for Rose Fox Noll (1934-2011) who was on the Board of Directors and supporter of the Heritage. A variety of plants flower during the spring and summer. The saucer magnolia was covered with pink flowers in March, the Spanish bluebells showed up in April and the 4 Double Delight roses will flower all summer.

The largest rose has a memorial plaque that reads, “In loving memory of Nanawin Currie, our double delight 30 Mar 1909 – 14 Oct 2004. Love from your grandchildren and great-grandchildren.” Three more Double Delights were planted recently. (photo)

A passion vine is thriving on the fence on the north side of the garden. The herbaceous vine climbs with tendrils or sprawls along the ground and will damage adjacent plants if not pruned. The intricate white flowers will bloom all summer. This plant was named Passionflower or Passion Vine because the floral parts were said to represent aspects of the Christian crucifixion story.

## Rooms Chapter 8 – Still On The Move!

You may remember that the last installment talked about the crises our three children had. At the end of that installment we were out of the Army and had moved to Mt Vernon, New York. Now, on with our migrations!

And On To San Francisco (Again!)
Nothing lasts forever – soon enough, we were on the move, again from New York to San Francisco. Duncan took a position as a resident at Stanford University’s San Francisco hospital. He found a lovely house for us at 24 Irving Street, in the inner Sunset, that turned out to be one of our favorites – he was great at finding good housing. The house still looks much as it did then, although what used to be a vacant, very steep hillside right across Irving and along Arguello Street is now a huge parking garage for the UCSF medical complex that overshadows the house.
The house had a back garden with a tree we thought was a “monkey puzzle tree” but was actually a Norfolk Island pine (closely related, in fact, both genus Araucaria). The dining room fireplace was made of clinker brick – they looked glassy and melted, and I fancied they had been salvaged from the 1906 earthquake fires, however unlikely that was. The living room also had a fireplace that we used a lot. I ordered coal because there was a coal bin in the garage, and we had good, hot fires to stave off the wind and the fog of the Sunset. Once, we hired an English nursing student to babysit the kids and she taught them how to put newspaper over the fire screen to make the fire draw better.
There was a cut-glass-paneled door between the living room and dining room, and the sun coming through it would make rainbow spots that would move slowly across the living room floor. The upstairs landing was huge, and the kids used it as a playroom. Only the kitchen was disappointing – very inconvenient and old-fashioned.
Life at that point was good. We didn’t have a lot of money, but enough to get by. The kids walked five blocks to school at Laguna Honda elementary on 6th Avenue (now Independence High School), Tom walked across Golden Gate Park to take horseback riding lessons. The kids made money letting fans at nearby Kezar Stadium park in our driveway on game days. We were living in one of San Francisco’s most interesting times, a sort of golden age with the beat generation and all that. Herb Caen documented it very well.

Manhattan, New York
And then, after two years, we moved again! The move from San Francisco back to New York in 1957 showed up one of the problems with moving children so often.
Duncan got a job at Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan and found us a magnificent, pre-war apartment at 229 West 78th Street, on the corner of Broadway. It was on the 7th floor and had three bedrooms, a maid’s room, a service entry off the kitchen, and a doorman. A milkman delivered milk to the service door. The doors between the living room and dining room were cut glass. Our packing-crate furniture looked sad in such an elegant setting! The large kitchen was old fashioned and inconvenient. The bathrooms had those little white hexagonal tiles, outlined in decades of incinerator soot. After a few months when it was clear the girls could no longer share a bedroom, Tom agreed to move into the maid’s room (pretty much a large closet off the kitchen, but away from the rest of the family, which he enjoyed), and the girls each had her own room, to our great relief.
We enrolled the kids in nearby private schools – Tom at Trinity on 91st street, the girls at St Hilda’s and St Hugh’s on 114th Street, and that’s when they learned about public transportation. It was a stressful time. Coming into private New York schools from public California schools, the kids were desperately behind. Tom didn’t know fractions at all when his 6th grade classmates could multiply and divide compound fractions. Anne in second grade didn’t know how to read. So our first few months were spent lining up tutors and crash-coursing the kids to catch up. And at the same time they had to deal with serious culture shock – they had never had school uniforms, and the expected behaviors and all the rest on the upper West Side of Manhattan were very foreign.
At the same time, it was New York City! I enjoyed that apartment and that time in New York for a while. But soon enough, Duncan decided it was time to move on and to make a good living for his family, New York being a serious financial strain. He went out to California again – this time to Palo Alto – and took a job at the Palo Alto Clinic. For some time it wasn’t clear what would happen to us, and to help deal with the uncertainty I took a part-time job in a greeting card shop in the huge subway station complex at 50th Street. Boring, but a help with finances.
Eventually, however, Duncan sent for us, and in the summer of 1959 the three kids and I set out across the country in a 1957 VW convertible to the next set of rooms, one of the most remarkable homes I have lived in. The trip and our next home next time!



24 Irving Street, San Francisco, as it looked in 1956. It’s very similar now, but with street trees in front.

229 W. 78th St, New York today. Our lobby door (now blocked off) was just beyond the pedestrian.

## The History of Fort Mason

Defending the Bay Fort Mason, located on a hilltop promontory, was an excellent location for harbor defenses because the promontory commanded the cove and the passage between the mainland and Alcatraz. Over the past 200 years it has been fortified by the Spanish, the Mexicans and the United States Government.

Fort Mason was originally named the “Post at Point San Jose.” Following the Civil War, the post became the headquarters of the U.S. Army 9th Infantry Regiment, and served as the military headquarters for the U.S. Army on the West Coast.
In 1882 the defenses were named for Richard Barnes Mason, a military governor.

After the 1906 earthquake, it served as a refugee camp for earthquake and fire victims. In 1912 three piers and several warehouses were built along the water to warehouse army supplies and provide docking space for army transport ships.
By 1915, a railroad tunnel had been built to connect with the railroad network and the Port of San Francisco.

During World War II, Fort Mason’s logistical transport hub moved 23 million tons of cargo and deployed a million troops. It was the principal port for the Pacific campaign. Its piers continued to be busy throughout the Korean War.

In the 1960s, the U.S. Army closed Fort Mason as an active military base, and in 1972 transferred ownership of the site to the National Park Service (NPS). The Fort Mason Center, a nonprofit organization, was established in 1977 to oversee adaptation of the fort's historic buildings for use as an arts center.

Today it is part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the site of several cultural facilities. The entire fort area is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places, with 49 buildings of historic significance, spread over 1,200 acres, while the lower port area is a National Historic Landmark District, designated for its role in World War II.
