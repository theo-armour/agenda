One of the delights of living at Heritage on the Marina is that there are virtually no rules or obligationsâ€”apart from paying the rent, of course. We are free to come and go as and when we please. We can have guests over whenever we like.

Nonetheless, when we are dealing with services provided by team members, it is worth remembering that they are people too. They have their own lives and families, and they are here to help us. So, it is important to treat them with respect and consideration.

Here are a few guidelines to help us all get along:

Meal Service Hours are as follows:
Breakfast 7:30am-9:30am
Lunch 11:15am-1:00pm
Dinner 5:15pm-7:00pm

During these hours, the kitchen staff are busy preparing and serving meals. Dining staff will take and serve your orders. If you arrive late, they may have already started cleaning up. So, please be on time.

The Dining Room itself

* Opens at 7:30am;
* Closes at 7:30pm.

During these hours, when the kitchen is closed, you can contact staff for meal requests and make reservations for your guests and make requests for bag lunches.
