Hello Heritage Residents

[_Heritage Happenings_ **Newsletter**]( https://heritage-happenings.github.io/happenings-issues/2024/2024-08-happenings-newsletter.pdf )

[_Heritage Happenings_ **Calendar**]( https://heritage-happenings.github.io/happenings-issues/2024/2024-08-happenings-calendar.pdf)

The _Heritage Happenings_ **Residents Directory** has also been updated this month. Your copy is attached to the botton of this email.

As part of the monthly **Around the World** program, _Heritage Happenings_ visits **Spain**. Look for the red and yellow colors of the Spanish flag theme. Look for Ferdinand the Bull blowing a trumpet as herald of the month for the masthead cameo.

I am now employing my niece Mia Cotton Harlock as Associate Editor to help with publishing the Calendar and adding new features to the Newsletter. Mia is a talented and experienced writer and editor. I am delighted to have Mia on board.

Cheers,

Theo

Editor and Designer, _Heritage Happenings_
