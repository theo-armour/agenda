## Rooms 10

Rooms Chapter 10 – Cross Country Again!!!
You may remember from the last installment that in 1959, we took an epic trip across the country and moved to a huge old house in Palo Alto.
Always On The Move
Palo Alto was a good time, but Duncan could not stay put for long. In 1962 we moved back to New York City, this time to an apartment in the Riverdale section of The Bronx at 641 West 231st Street. Duncan and Elizabeth drove the now-aging VW back across the country, enduring a multi-day breakdown in Nebraska, and Anne and I flew back to New York (Tom was already back east, in boarding school).
Riverdale, The Bronx
It was an uninspired post-war building with characterless boxes for rooms and a nasty landlord. The nearest subway stop at Broadway and 231st Street, was at the bottom of a steep hill, and the commuter train station was at the bottom of the other side of the hill, so transportation to Manhattan was tedious.
The apartment was totally unmemorable and not pleasant, being dark, inconvenient, and poorly insulated -- I remember frost on the insides of the window panes when a particularly cold winter wind came up off the Hudson River; that year, the Hudson River froze over, a rare event even back then.
A vivid memory of that apartment was dropping the Thanksgiving turkey out of the oven, turkey fat spreading across the kitchen floor. Our friends’ toddler, startled by the commotion, ran towards his father at the other end of the kitchen, skidded in the fat and flew up in the air, but was caught mid-flight by his father before he could hit the floor or a counter. Very dramatic!
And our cat fetched toothpaste tube caps, like a dog. We could bounce them down the hall into the bathtub, where she would chase them around before bringing them back to repeat. That lasted until the time someone had drawn a bath, so instead of hearing a clatter she heard a plop, and tried vainly to turn around in mid-air before landing in the water.
A Good Place
In February of 1965 we moved from Riverdale to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, in what had been an old immigrant neighborhood. Our apartment was on the 19th floor of a middle-income “city co-op”, right on the East River Drive and the East River, with an unobstructed southwestern view of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Wall Street skyline (a stunning nighttime view), and the Statue of Liberty. Originally designed as low-income housing, it had recently been converted to middle-income housing by adding balconies, a second bathroom, and more closets. Duncan’s income was just under the maximum to be eligible, which was why we qualified.
We were very happy there - we had brand new construction, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and an expansive balcony where we grew roses, vines, and a crab apple tree. Our building had a very congenial, diverse population and we had wonderful neighbors. The whole building lit up at Christmas; one of our neighbors enveloped their front door in foil and decorated it like a Christmas tree - we looked forward to it every year because they never did the same thing twice. We enjoyed that apartment enough to live there for nearly six years – a record for us to that point.
There was always something happening on the river and at the wharf right below us, and Duncan gave me a set of binoculars so that I became expert in identifying the busy river traffic. The balcony made a lovely spot for cocktails and morning coffee, marred only by the constant drone of traffic on the East River Drive. That was the last year the Brooklyn Navy Yard was open, and I particularly remember an aircraft carrier nearly filling the river when they turned it to slide into drydock, and Spain’s only submarine coming in for repairs. One weekend we watched an emergency readiness exercise in which small airplanes did very short take-offs from the dock below us -- noisy, but fascinating.
Life On The Lower East Side
Our neighborhood was not close to any major subway, and the bus that took us to downtown Manhattan was like the community itself - friendly, safe, and informal, where people knew each other. I found fresh, locally grown produce and cooking tips in an Italian market - eggs, Jersey tomatoes, excellent lettuce. We were on the fringe of Chinatown -- at that time still quite small -- and I began to teach myself Asian cooking. Further west, near the Hudson, was the spice, tea, and coffee wholesale district, very fragrant, where you could buy freshly ground spices and whole-bean coffee – construction of the World Trade Center at that time soon obliterated much of that area.
The neighborhood was formerly a Jewish enclave but many of the original inhabitants had moved out to Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, and today’s largely Asian inhabitants had not yet arrived. The neighborhood had an almost antiquarian feel because little had changed for decades. Our long Sunday walks throughout lower Manhattan were fascinating, like walks through history, where you could see preserved the ways of life and commerce of the late 19th century through the 1930s and 40s.
I worked at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital developing photomicrographs for cancer researchers, and had a great time experimenting with darkroom techniques. Duncan worked at Cornell New York Hospital, in the east sixties. Elizabeth went to Hunter College High School and Anne started at Bronx High School of Science – those were two of the best public high schools in the city at the time.
The Great Northeastern Blackout Of 1965
Anne had a really long subway ride to school, so I was relieved when she and Elizabeth got home from school before the lights went out. Duncan wasn’t so lucky, having to walk down 20 flights at the hospital, four miles through dark city streets, and up 19 flights of stairs to our apartment by the light of candles neighbors put out on the landings. The girls and I spent the evening reading Dracula by candlelight.
Moving On Again
Eventually, Duncan decided that to be financially secure later in life he would have to increase our income, and he took a position as a consulting pathologist in southeastern Iowa. So, we moved to Iowa, and that’s the next story!


Me on the balcony of 675 Water Street 19A in about 1966. A cargo ship is at the dock below us, the Statue of Liberty is just visible beyond the Brooklyn Bridge, to the left of the Wall Street buildings, and the East River is full of ship traffic.

My Village Grandmothers
Eleanor Bissell
I grew up in a small rural town in Massachusetts, the seventh of eleven children. During my preschool years, while my older siblings were in school and the younger children were not yet playmates, I discovered a rich resource - the elderly women in the community who were eager for company.
My "natural" grandmother was an artist who lived alone in a cluttered house. My treat was to watch Grandma B draw with old broken crayons on any kind of paper. She wrote poems while creating beautiful flowers, scenic wonders of all seasons. From Grandma B. I learned to listen and observe, to recycle paper and string and to save pennies.
Grandma W, a neighbor, also lived alone. She was quick to answer the doorbell and always apologized for not having her teeth in. This grandma of affection welcomed my stories, family secrets and tall tales. I was in my element as an entertainer with an appreciative audience.
Grandma L, another neighbor, painted a magical garden mural covering a wall in her parlor. She served tea in miniature antique cups and read from old, illustrated children's books. Grandma L's home was peaceful.
My relationship with elders grew as I did. Unconditional acceptance, mutual appreciation and respect carried over into my teen years, young adulthood and adulthood. It was from the elders I received strength, courage, wisdom and inspiration
As a resident at The Heritage I have the pleasure of knowing elders with many years of experience, a fertile place rich with wisdom stories. It is heartwarming to witness the bonds between generations as they unfold in our community, relationships that are an important part of who we become I wrote this poem as an ode to a three-year-old celebrating his friend Minna's 101st birthday:
Standing opposite Minna With a grin she could not see
In a sweet, shy voice she could not hear
Peter sang Happy Birthday to You"
Minna joined in "Happy Birthday to Me"
Anyone who heard the duet of these two friends
Singing together across the century
Knows there is an essence
Transcending sight and hearing
