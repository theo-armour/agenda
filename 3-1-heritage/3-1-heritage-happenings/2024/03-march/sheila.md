Giants causeway formed by a volcanic eruption eons ago, which could very slowly and formed these pilings of stones. I was thrilled to see it as seen many magazine photographs this stones are hexagon and foreign piles. Giants causeways along the northern engine coast Scotland is only 37 mi distant


we drove southerly and crossed the river Shannon estuary by ferry. lovely pastoral green scenery looking out to Tralee in the Atlantic Ocean. there are flocks of sheep everywhere in Ireland, and so it's green as it rains a lot.

we we set off to tour the ring of Kerry. me and a shop holding a complimentary Irish coffee, at 9:00 a.m.! lovely Willems and cashmere in all the shops.

you lie on your back, that men support you, and you kiss the Barney Stone upside down. when it came to my turn I could see the ground way down below, and I chickened out. I did kiss the bony stone 40 years ago however on my first visit to Ireland. inside the room that is Blondie Castle. to reach this elevated spot I had to climb on all fours up a narrow narrow spiral staircase and a separate spiral staircase down. it was very difficult for me at 72 years old!

we had a pub evening at this cozy satch is that true pub near tramore. The pub had a burning fireplace, and adjoining bedroom where wakes are held. basically a drinking party with speeches and eulogies honoring the dead person line on the bed .

we drove to glendello with its ruins of a center of Irish antiquity Christianity founded by St Kevin. The tall round tower was used as a defensive hiding place by the monks and is beautifully preserved. I climb it around the age of gravestones. The monks were ravaged by marauding Vikings. Will preserved ruins of an Abbey and a path leading to a beautiful lake.

typical example of an Irish pub, pubs are everywhere.

I found the area in the center of Dublin that had many Irish music bars. Dublin is attractive with all the flower bowls. The temple bar this was featured in an article on the pubs of Dublin in our Sunday chronicle recently. I went inside the temple bar pub and it was busy even at noon. I had a half pint of beer for 3.6.0 Euros $5.50. these men are drinking full pints of Guinness. Dublin is full of pubs

Dublin. Statue of Malone featured in the Irish ballad of that name.

we stopped at Dingle, a small town for lunch. main Street of Dingle with Murphy's pub. typical Irish pub you see all across Ireland in June it is warm and sunny, and patron sit outside

we drove in a drizzle to see the clips of mohar, county Clare. I walked to the cliff edge in rain but it was so fogged in that I could not distinguish the eclipse at all, so I bought this postcard to see what they look like. The cliffs are more rice 702 ft above the Atlantic. as soon as we left the visibility cleared

we spent an evening at the Guinness storehouse, which is a giant brewery right in the center of Dublin. we were showed the giant bats and the processes. then on the rooftop of Guinness brewery we were treated to complimentary pints. this is John Hood our team director.
