Aging in Place ~ Accepting Your Age

For most of us, for most of our lives, we have been generous, mindful of the needs of others and willing and able to lend a helping hand. This is the way we have led our lives in the past. This is the way we want to be in the future. But can this wish last forever? Will you be able to do what you did last year—next year? If you are careful, diligent, and lucky: yes. But for many us, aging will take its toll.

There is much to learn about aging. I am finding that Heritage on the Marina is a superb resource for learning how to age well. One of the important things I am learning is to accept the generosity of others. When people give warning, I try to take heed. When people offer to lend me a hand, I try to accept their offer.

Some examples: Yes, I can still do my laundry by myself (even if it takes twice as long as it used to take). On the other hand, if I let Heritage do my laundry, I could use the time to push my walker around the block. No, I do not want some person in the shower with me. Then again, a person with eyes better than mine looking for inflammations, dirty toenails and odd “growies” might be lifesaving. Maybe I can keep track of all the medications I should take highly accurately. Um, maybe, I can’t always do that.

Heritage on the Marina has a corps of well-trained caregivers that are familiar, available on site, and at a cost lower than the same services if you were living at home.  If I want to age successfully, my objective must be not to say “No, I can do it.” but to say “Yes, please feel free to help me! I can show you how.”
