Rooms Chapter 7 – We Nearly Lose Anne, Back To New York
You may remember that at the end of the last installment my family was living in Killeen, Texas, because Duncan had been called back into the Army for the Korean War.

Family Traumas
All three of our children have had traumatic crises that I remember vividly, and the first being in Killeen, I’ll digress here to recount them.
Near the end of our time in Killeen, when she was four, Anne very nearly died from a ruptured appendix. That was a tense time, with Anne in the Army base hospital and Tom (8 years old) and Elizabeth (6) being taken care of by Lenny and Susan, our neighbors up the block. The poor little thing was in the hospital for many weeks, not eating and getting weaker and thinner as she fought the infection. Most nights Duncan stayed with Anne at the hospital, and I took the day, but if he had night duty, I would stay with her.
Finally, I had to send Tom and Elizabeth to their grandmother in Atlanta so we could concentrate on caring for Anne. They flew by themselves, and it was only thanks to some alert passengers that they actually got off in Atlanta, as the stewardesses had totally forgotten about them.
Eventually the doctors decided they had to open Anne up again to get out the remnant infection. Two days later she woke up, saw the little girl who was her roommate having breakfast, and asked, “May I have some bacon, Mother?” To this day, after 70 years, remembering that frail little voice finally asking for food brings me to tears -- it was such a close call! We took her home shortly after that, and for weeks she ate nothing but meat, eggs – 6 at a sitting! – and, oddly, cauliflower (I can’t imagine what is in cauliflower that her body needed, but I guess there was something). Eventually she recovered sufficiently for us to drive to Atlanta to get Tom and Elizabeth.
The next scary thing happened to our eldest, Tom. In the late 1960s, while we were living on the Lower East Side of New York City, Tom was in the Navy as a hospital corpsman – a medic – and had been posted to Vietnam. There he ended up with a Marine infantry company – as you can imagine, we were terribly worried.
One morning in 1969 I came down to the apartment building’s mailboxes to find a letter with a military postmark, not in Tom’s handwriting. I was terrified and almost overwhelmed, but it turned out to have been written by a corpsman on a hospital ship, where Tom had ended up after being wounded when his unit got overrun in a night battle in the DMZ. He couldn’t write himself because one of the injuries left his right hand bandaged up.
After Tom arrived Stateside, the Navy decided to send him back to active duty, which could have meant back to Vietnam. Duncan was having none of that: Tom had done his duty and needed to get out. Duncan immediately hired the best law firm in New York at taking on the military and, at great expense, got the Navy to release Tom on a medical retirement.
The final crisis was Elizabeth’s, a couple of years later when we lived in Iowa. At 2 a.m. the phone rang, Duncan answered it, and the first thing he said was, “what do you need?” -- again springing into action without hesitation when our children needed help. I listened in on the other phone and found out that our daughter had been arrested and thrown in jail by Seattle police during a peaceful protest of the trial of the Seattle Seven. She was the girlfriend of one of the Seven, and apparently that was all the police needed. Lacking real grounds, they charged her with assaulting an officer, although her arm was in a sling from having been broken in a car accident.
Duncan promptly arranged bail and legal representation. The judge threw out the charges and she came back to Iowa to recuperate. Painfully thin from malnutrition on the hippie brown rice diet popular at the time with the “flower children,” she mended slowly, but eventually we got her back to health.

Back To New York, Again
In 1954, shortly after Anne’s crisis, Duncan’s Army stint ended and he got a job at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York City. We couldn’t wait to escape from Killeen! Duncan went on ahead, as usual, and found us a spacious apartment in the Fleetwood section of Mount Vernon, a suburb of New York.
The apartment was the upstairs of a duplex at 341 Packman Avenue; our landlady lived on the ground floor with her two grown daughters, the first television my children had ever seen, and an accordion. Duncan could walk three blocks to the commuter train station – in those days the New York Central’s Hudson line, now Metro North – and the kids could walk four blocks to Pennington Elementary School, so it was a very typical American 1950s suburban life.
The apartment itself was not particularly memorable, but I do remember two amusing incidents. One was finding Anne at the foot of the stairs, bag packed, ready to run away from home -- she was 5 or 6 at the time – but stymied by not knowing where to go. The other was sending the kids off to school right after an ice storm had covered everything, including the sidewalks. They slipped and slid to school, and were promptly sent home, but meanwhile I got a couple of hours of peace and quiet to myself – always welcome with three active kids!
Next time: Back to San Francisco!
