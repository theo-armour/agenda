Rooms Chapter 7 – We Nearly Lose Anne, Back To New York
You may remember that at the end of the last installment my family was living in Killeen, Texas, because Duncan had been called back into the Army for the Korean War.

Family Traumas
All three of our children have had traumatic crises that I remember vividly, and the first being in Killeen, I’ll digress here to recount them.
Near the end of our time in Killeen, when she was four, Anne very nearly died from a ruptured appendix. That was a tense time, with Anne in the Army base hospital and Tom (8 years old) and Elizabeth (6) being taken care of by Lenny and Susan, our neighbors up the block. The poor little thing was in the hospital for many weeks, not eating and getting weaker and thinner as she fought the infection. Most nights Duncan stayed with Anne at the hospital, and I took the day, but if he had night duty, I would stay with her.
Finally, I had to send Tom and Elizabeth to their grandmother in Atlanta so we could concentrate on caring for Anne. They flew by themselves, and it was only thanks to some alert passengers that they actually got off in Atlanta, as the stewardesses had totally forgotten about them.
Eventually the doctors decided they had to open Anne up again to get out the remnant infection. Two days later she woke up, saw the little girl who was her roommate having breakfast, and asked, “May I have some bacon, Mother?” To this day, after 70 years, remembering that frail little voice finally asking for food brings me to tears -- it was such a close call! We took her home shortly after that, and for weeks she ate nothing but meat, eggs – 6 at a sitting! – and, oddly, cauliflower (I can’t imagine what is in cauliflower that her body needed, but I guess there was something). Eventually she recovered sufficiently for us to drive to Atlanta to get Tom and Elizabeth.
The next scary thing happened to our eldest, Tom. In the late 1960s, while we were living on the Lower East Side of New York City, Tom was in the Navy as a hospital corpsman – a medic – and had been posted to Vietnam. There he ended up with a Marine infantry company – as you can imagine, we were terribly worried.
One morning in 1969 I came down to the apartment building’s mailboxes to find a letter with a military postmark, not in Tom’s handwriting. I was terrified and almost overwhelmed, but it turned out to have been written by a corpsman on a hospital ship, where Tom had ended up after being wounded when his unit got overrun in a night battle in the DMZ. He couldn’t write himself because one of the injuries left his right hand bandaged up.
After Tom arrived Stateside, the Navy decided to send him back to active duty, which could have meant back to Vietnam. Duncan was having none of that: Tom had done his duty and needed to get out. Duncan immediately hired the best law firm in New York at taking on the military and, at great expense, got the Navy to release Tom on a medical retirement.
The final crisis was Elizabeth’s, a couple of years later when we lived in Iowa. At 2 a.m. the phone rang, Duncan answered it, and the first thing he said was, “what do you need?” -- again springing into action without hesitation when our children needed help. I listened in on the other phone and found out that our daughter had been arrested and thrown in jail by Seattle police during a peaceful protest of the trial of the Seattle Seven. She was the girlfriend of one of the Seven, and apparently that was all the police needed. Lacking real grounds, they charged her with assaulting an officer, although her arm was in a sling from having been broken in a car accident.
Duncan promptly arranged bail and legal representation. The judge threw out the charges and she came back to Iowa to recuperate. Painfully thin from malnutrition on the hippie brown rice diet popular at the time with the “flower children,” she mended slowly, but eventually we got her back to health.

Back To New York, Again
In 1954, shortly after Anne’s crisis, Duncan’s Army stint ended and he got a job at Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in New York City. We couldn’t wait to escape from Killeen! Duncan went on ahead, as usual, and found us a spacious apartment in the Fleetwood section of Mount Vernon, a suburb of New York.
The apartment was the upstairs of a duplex at 341 Packman Avenue; our landlady lived on the ground floor with her two grown daughters, the first television my children had ever seen, and an accordion. Duncan could walk three blocks to the commuter train station – in those days the New York Central’s Hudson line, now Metro North – and the kids could walk four blocks to Pennington Elementary School, so it was a very typical American 1950s suburban life.
The apartment itself was not particularly memorable, but I do remember two amusing incidents. One was finding Anne at the foot of the stairs, bag packed, ready to run away from home -- she was 5 or 6 at the time – but stymied by not knowing where to go. The other was sending the kids off to school right after an ice storm had covered everything, including the sidewalks. They slipped and slid to school, and were promptly sent home, but meanwhile I got a couple of hours of peace and quiet to myself – always welcome with three active kids!
Next time: Back to San Francisco!

## A Coronation Story
By Jane Standing

I was working at 61 Threadneedle Street on February 6 1952 when someone came in and said the King had died. We did not quite believe it. But we soon found out that it was true.and that he was much sicker than the public knew. My boy friend, Barry, and I were going to the theater that night because it was my birthday but all the theaters were closed. We could have gone out to diner but we did not feel like it and went back to our respective homes instead..
Elizabeth was in Kenya. She left England a Princess and came back a Queen. As she returned to London and came down the steps of ther plane in deepest morning, perfectly composed, she was greeted by Prime Minister Winston Churchill as well as other members of the Cabinet.  Churchill was visibly emotional.
After the solemnity of the King’s funeral it was time to plan Queen Elizabeth’s coronation which was to take place on June 2 1953. All London was “en fete”. In the city there were window boxes with flowers in almost every building including the one I worked. There were banners and signs everywhere and The Mall had a spectacular overhead display.
My boyfriend, now my fiancé’s mother was a Londoner and a staunch royalist and insisted that we go up to see the Coronation. We took the last tube train up from Uxbridge at I believe one thirty in the morning and stood in Hyde Park opposite The Dorchester Hotel. A very nice location. We were so early that we had a front row view. Did we sit on the curb?  I cannot remember. We had flasks of tea and sandwiches to sustain us.   The service was broadcast on loud speakers so we could hear what was going on. And then came the parade. I will never forget the gold coach coming by, with the queen in her coronation robes and the crown on her head. So young and beautiful -  only in her twenties.  A sight burned in my brain.  I don’t believe it was raining then but soon the heavens opened  and all the parade got soaked. It was so sad to see the soldiers in their red jackets and bearskin hats and all of the other participants including the the commonwealth contingents. I remember especially the Gurkhas from India and the Queen of Tonga in an open landau refusing an umbrella and smiling broadly.  She wanted to see and be seen.
After it was all over my fiancé’s father said “come with me’”  We were as soaked as everyone else.  He led us under the trees and produced a  very welcome flask of brandy. We all took a hearty swig, took the train home, dried off and went to bed exhausted but happy that we had been there.
It was a different era, no cell phones, iPads or computers We had to go to the cinema to see the actual coronation and my vision  of all the nobles in their red velvet robes and ermine was magnificent.  ( the smell of mothballs must have overcome the smell of the incense). Apparently how many black blobs on your ermine and how many silver balls on your coronet denoted your rank.  It was rumored that because the service  was so long some coronets contained packets  of sandwiches. At the actual crowning they cried “’God save the Queen” and put their coronets on hopefully sans sandwiches. The service was televised but not many people had televisions and they would have been small black and white affairs anyway.
 King Charles had a much simpler coronation and I doubt if we will ever see such a splendid spectacle again.


## Yvonne sys:

I have more, but you asked for a few, so I am sharing these.  No author for any of these, just sayings we Irish use:
An Irishman is never drunk as long as he can hold on to one blade of  grass and not fall off the face of the Earth.
A trout in the pot is better than a salmon in the sea.
If you lie down with dogs you'll rise with fleas.
Life's journey is not to arrive safely at the grave in a well preserved body, but rather to skid in sideways, totally worn out, shouting "HOLY COW, WHAT A RIDE"
