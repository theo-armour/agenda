# 2024-02-25 Request for Tidbits

Did you ever go so far to see the Cliffs of Mohar?

Have you ever passed an evening rumblin' in Dublin?

Did you ever ride the night ferry to County Kerry?

Have you ever been all the way to faraway Galway?

Did you ever mingle with singles in Dingle?

Were you ever bestowed the gift of gab by kissing the Blarney Stone?

If so, please send your words about your visit in person or even by phone!

This month Activities, Dining and Happenings will be featuring Ireland. If you have any stories, photos or other tidbits to share, please send them to me at t.armour@gmail.com or phone me or stop by the press room (#227C) by Tuesday.
