### You Notes for HotM Residents Council Meeting July 28

Hi Mary, Jeff and Patrick

An ongoing issue with Residents Council meetings is that some resident cannot attend, some residents have hearing and other impairments and other cannot remember what was said.

It would be helpful if the meeting notes could be made available to residents while they attend the meeting.

Mary, you have been wonderful at preparing excellent summaries of your talks prior to the meeting. I hope that other staff members will follow your good example.

I understand that one of you will be speaking at the meeting tomorrow. If you could prepare a summary of your talk and have it printed out for attendees, that would be very helpful.

By the way, I note that 14 point Verdana font is a suggested size and font for the visually impaired. I am sure you will agree that it is important that all residents be able to read your notes. I set the margins to half inch per side to reduce the page count.





### HotM Residents Council Action Items of July 18

Hi Mary, Jeff and Patrick

Regarding the Residents Council meeting of July 18, 2023, I assume you (and Michael) received the three action item PDFs, I prepared on behalf of the residents. Patrick forgot to copy the signatories on the email he sent to you, so please do confirm receipt.

I note that Mary's "CEO Note" for that meeting states:

"1.b. Within 20 days of receiving written notification of the RC meeting requests to administration, the administration is required to provide written feedback to residents."

I think we all look forward to your feedback. I am sure you will agree that the residents' concerns are important and should be addressed and communicated in a calm, deliberative manner.

Personally I have little experience in this type of deliberation, so I am not sure what to expect. I am sure you will be able to guide us through the process.

Theo
