# 2023-05-17 RC Notes

## Agenda

* 90 day notice: resignation from post as RC secretary
* Not cut out for the job, in particular the time commitment to taking and publishing notes of meetings.

## Technical issues

* Internet connect is not good enough to support transcription software.
* Use of computer microphone is not good enough to to obtain good quality audio.

Will be working to see if I can connect my computer to the audio system in Friendship Hall

## Speakers Notes

* Speaker's note really help
* But getting speaker's notes takes multiple passes before and after the meeting
* Frequently, notes are never submitted

## Preparation of the notes

* Preparation of the notes takes a lot of time
* Having both a technical and a design background I expect what ever I produce to be accurate, authoritative, pleasing to the eye and accessible to the readers with a variety ogf impairments.
* I'm not sure which takes longer, the preparation of the notes or the procrastination of the preparation of the notes.
* In any case the effort is burning up too much of my time.

## Utility of notes

* Does anyone read the notes?
* Does anyone use the notes?
* Does anyone care about the notes?
