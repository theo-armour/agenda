# 2023-06-15 RC Officers

Hello RC Officers

Thank you Patrick for sending out the revised agenda for this evenings meeting.

Two observations:

Reply to Mary's email
A priority will be to respond to the email that Mary sent us yesterday. I drafted a possibly reply in the message I sent to us all yesterday.

In it, I applauded the idea of restructuring the RC minutes, but asked that Mary consider sending the officers a draft of the message she planned to send to residents. I ask for the draft simply because Mary's emails sometimes seem to raise more issues than they solve. We might be able to help her avoid that.

Also, if Mary sends her email out soon, then this means that the June RC meeting may be held without staff in attendance. If so then the officers need to come up with a new agenda.

Laundry List of Issues
Earlier this week. I sent out a long list of issues that have been discussed at Residents Council meetings where things have been promised but action has not been taken or completed. I think all of us could add more items.

I think we should discuss this list at the meeting tonight. We should also discuss how we can get these issues resolved.

On the other hand, bringing up a long list of bad things happening at the Residents Council meeting may not be the best way to run a meeting. It will only serve to cause more worry and stress among residents. I suggest that we discuss how to deal with this list after we have discussed the email that Mary plans to send out.
