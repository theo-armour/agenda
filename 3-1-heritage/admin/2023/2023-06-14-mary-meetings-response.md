## Mary's email of 2023-06-14

Suggested wording for a response to Mary's email of 2023-06-14:

>Thank you for your email of 2023-06-14 proviiding a heads-up regarding the upcoming updates to the semiannual meeting.
>
>The Residents Council officers note and appreciate your efforts to improve the quality of the residents meetings.
>
>The Residents Council officers are simultaneously trying to improve the quality of the meetings.
>
>The Residents Council officers appreciate being able to review a draft of the text you would like to send to the residents regarding the semiannual meeting prior to sending. In return the officers will send you a draft of messages relating to the organization meeting that the officers would like to send to the residents prior to sending.
>
>The objective in all this is to reduce stress and worry among both residents and staff.



## Continuing Care Contract Statutes

Mary quotes the statutes, but unfortunately does not provide a link to the statutes.

Here is a link to copies of the statutes:

* https://california.public.law/codes/ca_health_and_safety_code_section_1771.7
* https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/health-and-safety-code/hsc-sect-1771-7/


## Semiannual Meetings

Here is a summary of what I think Mary is proposing

* Staff organize the meetings required by the statutes
* Quite apart from the Residents Council meetings
* Run entirely by staff
* Twice a year
* On date, time and place of their choosing
* Agenda and notes are prepared by staff

I suggest the RC accepts the above and requests:

* Semiannual meetings have a published agenda
* Semiannual meetings are based on PowerPoints
* PowerPoints are displayed during the meeting
* Text of slides shall readable by slightly visually impaired residents sitting at the maximum distance from the screen
* Semiannual meetings are held on Zoom
* Meetings are recorded
* Audio is transcribed
* Transcription is summarized by AI
* Audio, transcription and Summary are made available to staff and residents


## Residents Council Meetings

Here is what I think are ways of proceeding

RC meetings:

* Held monthly as stipulated in the RC bylaws
* Run entirely by residents
* Agenda and notes are prepared by residents
* Staff are not required to attend
* Staff selected by the RC are invited to attend

I suggest the RC accepts and requests help with:

* Residents Council meetings are held on Zoom
* Meetings are recorded
* Audio is transcribed
* Transcription is summarized by AI
* Audio, transcription and Summary are made available to staff and residents


## Fact Checking

Mary says:

>I know we have done it “the Heritage Way” for a long time, but I think it is
time we correct it and get in line with the Statutes.

Mary does not describe “the Heritage Way”

I can describe what I know:

* "The virus no meeting way"
* "The Janet way"
* "The Mary way"

I think Mary is referring to the Residents Council meetings that were held before the virus. I have no idea what they were like. I never attended one. ;-)
