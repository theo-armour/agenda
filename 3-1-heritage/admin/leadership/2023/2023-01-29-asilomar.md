Report from your corresspondent stationed in Paific Grove CA

Greetings from the grounds of Asilomar the state park and conference center designed by our esteemed Julia Morgan

Life here can be quite rocky

Staying here has been otterly fantastic

There are chairs for people who want to celebrate happy hour

With some exceptions the pulchritude is plentiful
