## Subject: Introduction to Friends in Their Twenties

From: Siddique Ahmed <siddiqueafghan@gmail.com>

Hi Leah, [mutual friend]

I’m happy to introduce her [you] to some friends (not necessarily in their twenties but they surely know people in that age range). I was wondering if she is in need of help in any particular area (emergency help, networking/employment etc.) or is it just more on the social side?

Either way one of my friends Maryam, has a sister who is in her twenties.. they might be good people for her to meet.. they also know a lot of people. 

I’m happy to make the introduction.

Thanks
