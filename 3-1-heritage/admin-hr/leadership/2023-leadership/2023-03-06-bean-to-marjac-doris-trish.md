# rBeans to Doris Margaret & Trish

Hello Doris, Margaret & Trish

Attached, please find a copy of "Inasmuch..." - the one-hundred year history of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, 1853-1953, by alumna resident Rowena Beans. The copy is a PDF file of a scan of the 1953 original that I have refreshed and reformatted.

It is the first of three histories of the Society that I am attempting to revivify in celebration of the 170th anniversary of the founding of the Society. A further use of these histories will be for me to use their content as authoritative citations for Wikipedia articles for the Society and for the campus with its Julia Morgan treasure.

I have requested permission from Mary Linde to make the three works available with a "Creative Commons 4.0" license. TheÂ license will give everyone permission to copy and reuse the content as they please. I have also asked Jeff Brenner for his comments.

I will be printing a copy on paper and giving it to Midge - along with the copy of the book I scanned. I hope she will proofread it - looking in particular for scanning errors.

I have two requests:

1. Please look at the preface I have added. It is work-in-progress. The current tone is rather high-falutin'. Your suggestions welcome.

2. Please offer any thoughts or suggestions as to how this effort might tie in with any Heritage Herald efforts.

As and when this effort is complete, I plan to upload copies to the Internet Archive and Wikimedia Commons. Copies will also be made available to residents, staff, family and friends.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Theo
