# 2023-03-03 Mary CC Histories

Hi Mary

in celebration of the 170th anniversary of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society, I have acquired copies of the three significant histories that have been published by the Society.

I plan to scan each history and make each available as new editions in large print both as a PDF and on paper.

Attached is a copy of the current work-in-progress with the first history.

The more freely the gracious and engaged history of the Society is shared, the more likely the future of the society may emulate its past. Therefore I suggest the following.

The copyright included with each history indicates the Society as the copyright holder. To this, I request that the Society adds a license to these new editions that allows for free copying and reuse of the content.  I suggest the following license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/

Kindly allow me to add the following text under the copyright notice to each of the new editions:

"This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0)"
