# Notes for Meeting

## Clinics

Heritage currently offers inhouse clinics for podiatry, massage, hairdressing, tech support and phsical fitness. All of these services are well supported if not over subscribed.

Wellness for the aged equates positively to services coming inhouse to the elderly rather than the elderry going off the campus for services.

What other clinics might Heritage off that serve to help matainf wellbness for the elderly

Two possibuilities come to mind

Annual Skin Screening Clinic
I have discussed the idea of annual skin screenin clinics with Kari Cedillo of Pine Park Health, She supports the idea, and would be pleased to discuss the possibility with Heritage

I also discussed the idea with Dr Merlys Fassett, my dermatologist ooractiv=cing at UCSF. She reconnemdred two doctors inprivate practice who might interested in spoorting such a clinic

Regluar Ear Wax Removal Clinics
Loss of hearing is a significan factor in decreased socialization of rersidents. EEar wax build up is a cause of hearing loss. Residents frequently mention having been offsite in oder to have ear weax renoved.

If, instead, ear wax could be removed bay attending a schediled clinic, more resodents might participate more frequently in thre process of maintaing heakthy ears,

## Communications and liason

**Meal tray disposal**
A recent circumstance provoded evidence of lack of foresight. A pile of meal trays enfed up being created in the third floor Mprgan laundry room. Gail Lindlow and Elizabeth Jordan were having meals delivered to their apartments, After they had finished their meals they disposed of the trays by placing them on the floor outside their apartments. Apperently a CNA was moving the trays to the laundry room (apparently not knowing about the trash room).

Both these residents are significant fall risk possibilities. Carrying a tray requires two hands. Asking a fall risk person to carry a tray, open a door and place the tray on the floor is asking for trouble.

A process whereby the person who dilvers the meal to the apartment of a resident should also be charged with removing the tray from the apartment.

**Maintenance and other issues**
On Sunday the Perry elevator went out of service. Several hours after the outage, I emailed Cortez MacvFarland. I asked him if Maintenace knew about the outage, He responded that until my message came in that no report had been sent in.

It might be a good thing if the Henderson Clinic had a process that alerts staff to contact maintenance in the event of issues such as the elevator outage.

I note that the plastic card we were given has two nursing emergency numbers. I always wonder: which number should I call first and do I need to call both.

I also note that there is no overall emergency number. A nice thing to have would be a number that would go to an ansering service where the operators are instructed to call the appropriete person given a variety of circumstances.


## Staffing

Residents tend to have a very vague notion of the number and qualifications of staff are available at what times of the day and days of the week. It might be a nice thing to post publically the different staffing availabilties. Even nicer would be a bulletin board informing of the name and qualifications of stff currently on duty.

## Anticipated Costs

I am quite scared about enquiring about the cost of maintaining patients in assised living (or IL+). I believe that I am not alone. Fees and numbers are published but these are merely schedules of rates.

It would be highly useful to publish guidelines for what patients are currently paying. Perhep the high, low and average payments made on behalf of all AR residents might help.

## Three Books

What are three books that should be made available in the Stcky library that the elderly here should read in orser to prepare themselves for being very old?

Personal requests

## Quest for a Physical Therapy Coach

My walking is having such issues that I really need ti relaearn how to walk again. This is not likely to happen by a PTA walking me up the hall three times a week. It is likely to happen if I have access to a coach that pusshes me to carry out scertain sets of exercises five times a day.

I have requested referral to ONT/EmpowerME. Fingers crossed they can provide a coaching service. Should I contacy EmpoerMe or will they contact me.

## Rashes

What are some suggestions for over the counter meds to relieve rashes
