* Loose Cannon who can wreak havoc; aimed well I can launch projects into orbit ~ Need challenges, managing, discussion
* Vada: I like starting at a low rung on the ladder. CEO time is too precious to waste in low level matters
* Lillemor
* I want to learn the ropes: research, evidence, authority
* Wine & Cheese ~ another booboo ~ trying too hard to make things happen ~ $400 Cheese
* Never learned to manage my managers
