I need advice from somebody who sees the big picture

## Heritage Happenings

* Heritage Happenings is taking up a lot of my time.
* Perhaps 40 to 80 hours every month.
* I'm not sure if I should continue with it.
* Nobody else is interested in taking it up.
* I feel that it is required, but could I just stop?

## Calendar

* Calendar is most time-consuming and difficult aspect
* Activities & Coordination waste time

## Damage

* Can't travel
* Preventing work on other projects: 100th anniversary, Wikipedia

## Remedies

* Hiring Mia
