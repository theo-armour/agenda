Subject: Licenses for books published by the Society

Hi Mary

Below is a suggested text that I could add as an an addendum to to the new editions/reprints of the publications. This would be in addition to a note added under the copyright notice in the front matter of each publication stating "This work is licensed to the public under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license."

The goal:
> One goal of Creative Commons is to increase the amount of openly licensed creativity in “the commons” — the body of work freely available for legal use, sharing, repurposing, and remixing. Through the use of CC licenses, millions of people around the world have made their photos, videos, writing, music, and other creative content available for any member of the public to use.

The cost:
zero
