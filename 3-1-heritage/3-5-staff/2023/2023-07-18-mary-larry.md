## Forgiveness

As Admiral Grace Hopper said: "It's easier to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission."

Please forgive me.

## Diplomacy

I am the grandson of an American ambassador to seven countries.

I am the son of the a former acting Chief of Protocol of the United States.

I am the only child of nine in communication with all nine siblings.

Diplomacy is in my blood.

## Larry

Larry and I grew up a few miles from  each other in Long Island.

His former tenant, Jan Becker, was a friend and colleague of mine at Autodesk.

Larry and I both have extensive experience working with sports associations for the physically handicapped.

Larry will be pleased to invite me over to his house to discuss with children the implications of artificial intelligence in education.

Regarding Heritage, we talked of the beauty, the history, and very generally about the issues of modern life. We avoided discussing any specific discussion on the Strategic Plan.

## Mission Accomplished

My mission was simple: to demonstrate that Heritage is a home for living, breathing people who share many of the same values as Larry. I believe I accomplished that mission.
