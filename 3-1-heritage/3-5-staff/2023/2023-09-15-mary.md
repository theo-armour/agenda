May I invite you out for lunch or coffee or a walk to discuss about:

* How can I help?
* What are your goals in dealing with residents?

I am interested in:
* Advocacy, Pamela, statement of openness
* Article on current success of aging in place
* Cost-planning for aging here for continuing care residents
