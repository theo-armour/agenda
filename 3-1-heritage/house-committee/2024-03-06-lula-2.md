# LULA ~ Limited Use/Limited Application Elevator

## To Do

* ADA requirements
* Building code requirements
* RCFE requirements

## Preface

### Length

I apologize for the length of this document. I try to be as thorough as possible when it comes to creating an overview of a system,

The next step would be to highlight the half dozen primary areas of concern and to create a plan of action to address them.

### Headings

The section headings are off the top of my head. If Coreworks as a standard set of headings, I would be happy to reorganize the document to fit that standard.


## Introduction

This Document is being prepared by the Heritage on the Marina "House Committee". It is intended to provide an overview of the residence concerns and aspirations regarding the operation and maintenance of elevators on the campus.

## Conclusion: next steps

If you have a better set of headings, I would be happy to reorganize the document to fit that standard.

Please

* Cross out any sections you feel are low priority,
* Add things I missed
* Highlight the half dozen primary areas of concern

I will then create a second draft and circulate it to the Residents Council for review and comment.

I will then circulate a final draft to the residents of the "flats" for their review and comment.
