## From Michele



Hector,

Kristine asked what repairs were done?
I would add

What are the specs of the back up generator?

How long will it be before the Barrel Key is placed in the vicinity of the lift since that was the first thing SF Elevator asked for the day I was stuck in the lift?

Were the wiring diagrams located and referenced, as SF Elevator had wished or were they left to Troubleshoot blindly?

Was the speaker repaired?

When will the phone number of SF elevator be posted in the Lift, since the  connection is  very bad to speak with them over the speaker?

Is it necessary to hold the button down during the entire conversation with SF Elevator in the lift?

When will a diagram be posted so that repair personnel and fire personnel can find the appropriate set of wiring and power connections, which I understand are in two different places and required the assistance of another resident, Gary, Skootsky, on the day I was stuck?

What progress has  been made to consider  the jaws of life and its very large generator in the event SF Elevator is stuck in traffic as happened December 23 and we need to rely on the fire department in the small space?

Will SF elevator’s contact information be posted outside the elevator for the use of fire personnel who do not hold a certified conveyance mechanics license and cannot operate the oil pressure gauges in the event of generator or power issues?

Will the door that opens out … rather than sliding… continue to be locked and immobile when the elevator is between floors and if so, when will that explanation be posted in the lift, so that the next person stuck does not injure their spine trying to move that door?

When no maintenance personnel are on the premises as occurred at 3 PM on December 23, what is the procedure for coverage by maintenance personnel in order to escort the fire department and SF Elevator to the correct location? When no security staff Is on the premises, as was the case at 3 PM on December 23. What is the new procedure?

When no manager or maintenance staff is in the county of San Francisco, as was the case at 3 PM on December 23, how is 911 to be notified… I am advised by maintenance personnel that there is a problem calling 911 from outside the county and expecting expeditious service?

Has  the December failure of  nursing staff to respond to do a wellness check of a person trapped in the lift, even at the urging of management, been addressed, in terms of a clearer specification of their duties with respect to different buildings and in General as to emergencies?

Has the December failure of security staff to respond to needs of a person trapped in the lift, even after being notified by other personnel, been addressed in terms of a clear specification of their duties with respect to different buildings, and generally as to emergencies?

All of these things were either discussed with Randy Gridley January 9 or sent to him thereafter, as well as being widely transmitted prior to January 9.

Has the insurance company To which Heritage would make a claim , from whom  my medical insurer would seek subrogation, due to my injuries, done its walk-through and submitted reports or other communications?
Why have we not received the report or communications?

Is it reasonable and appropriate to reopen the lift without useful answers to the above?
