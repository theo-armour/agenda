* Heritage life #2: There are issues
* Personality conflicts
* Mis-communication
* Less than perfect: health services and maintenance

### Residents

* Extremely aged cohort, cannot rely on for anything
* Unprepared for change, very concerned, some stressed
* Minimal understanding or comprehension of the Strategic Plan
