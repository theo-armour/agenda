### For Simone

Hi Simone

Quick assignment - only if you have the time.

Today is resident Marcia Forman's birthday. I'd want to send her a strange birthday present.

Marcia went to high school in Sacramento and Cal with Joan Didion. I have asked her for a bio-sketch of her relations with Joan more than once.

In order to help Marcia, I have promised her a range of questions to help her get started. At last, I got out my typing fingers.

Please note: most people just write and send. I happen to be one of the few that prefers to seek out more eyes and ears before sending. This is particularly relevant here as Marcia is reluctant about the whole idea.

What I would want from you is not more than two or three sentences of observation or comment or just an "OK to send" or "Don't send yet" (if pressed for time but see something curious). I'd like to send before dinner time.

Theo

Hi Marcia

Happy Birthday

I hope you do not mind strange gifts: My gift to you is a list of possible questions - see below - regarding your observations on Joan Didion. The idea is that your recollections could be published in a future issue of the Heritage Happenings.

Please do not answer all the Questions!!! Perhaps just three to five observations would be sufficient to produce a one or two page article of about 400 words a page.

Also: there is no deadline whatsoever. Deciding not to write anything is absolutely acceptable. Writing because you feel happy about it is what counts.
