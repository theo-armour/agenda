Hi Jon

I am looking at your report on the financials for the meeting on the 21st. Thank you for the early share.

I am looking for a breakdown of the following:

* Office Supplies/Computers/IT Support: $307K
* Outside services: $2,321K
* Telephone Internet & Communications: $158K

In particular, as these are areas I tend to follow, I am interested in the expenses for TouchTown and the Heritage on the Marina website and associated systems and contractors.

On a side note: Looking at the second item in the Pre-Development Spend report, I am looking at the second item: "BLACKBAUD /IN: INV-081212 NXT Optional Module - 4/7/22 - 4/6/2"

https://www.blackbaud.com/ is a vendor of fund-raising software and the item is for an "optional module". I am interested in how this fits into the into the pre-development plan.

I understand that my queries may have come in too late for you to address at the meeting. I am happy to wait for the next meeting or for a separate report.
