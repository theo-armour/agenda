Generally

* Date: is March
* "Annual" column is a duplicate of the YTD budget column.

In other circumstances

* Curious presentation: Income statement with expenses as negative numbers. Normally there would be a separate expense statement.
* The report period is defined as "month". Normally the period is defined by the audience: operations: monthly, directors: quarterly, shareholders: annually. We meet semi-annually...
* Random category importance: some have seven digits while others have just two digits.
* Difficulty is arriving at the cost of individual services. What does transport by the van cost? How much do we spend on food? TouchTown?
