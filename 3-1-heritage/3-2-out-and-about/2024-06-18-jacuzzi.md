"I opened Jacuzzi Family Vineyards in 2007 to honor my beloved grandfather Valeriano Jacuzzi. As a teenager and young man, my grandfather taught me how to tease magic from the soil. The stonework and design of the Jacuzzi Family Vineyards and The Olive Press building is a tribute to our Jacuzzi family home in Casarsa, Italy." — Fred Cline

## FROM ITALY TO AMERICA
The Jacuzzi trek to America started in 1907, when Fred Cline's grandfather Valeriano and his brother emigrated to work on the railroad. A warmer climate beckoned and he eventually made his way to southern California. Years later, they were joined by their four brothers and all worked in the aviation industry. Soon they would make history. In 1911, Fred's great grandfather, Giovanni a skilled woodworker and vineyard farmer, joined his sons. Two weeks was enough to convince him that they would remain in California. Valeriano and Giovanni returned to Italy to gather up the remaining family but World War I intervened and their trip was delayed.

## INVENTORS
During his time in Italy, Valeriano met Giuseppina, fell in love and married. In 1920, he, his new wife and the remaining Jacuzzi family emigrated to America. At that time, Valeriano joined his brothers and worked at their Jacuzzi Brothers factory where they built the first enclosed cabin high-wing monoplane. A tragic crash, in Modesto, of Jacuzzi’s plane took several lives, including that of Valeriano’s brother, Giocondo. Giovanni asked his sons to cease making planes.

## FARMING
Valeriano moved his family to Northern California and purchased a 161-acre farm in Contra Costa County. During the depression, he along with help from his older children, planted a portion of the open farm fields with grapes and in 1936 applied for a license to make wine for home consumption. At that time, production was limited to 200 gallons (approximately 84 cases). The vineyard was planted to Zinfandel, Carignane and Mourvèdre. He sold grapes for $30-$35 a ton. In 1937, Valeriano returned to work with his brothers at Jacuzzi Brothers, Inc. located in Berkeley, CA where they manufactured water well pumps and eventually, the bath and spa that bears their name.

## Sonoma

Sonoma's origins date to 1823, when the Spaniard José Altimira established Mission San Francisco Solano, under the direction of Governor Luis Antonio Argüello. Following the Mexican secularization of the missions, famed Californio statesman Mariano G. Vallejo founded Sonoma on the former mission's lands in 1835. Sonoma served as the base of General Vallejo's operations until the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846, when American filibusters overthrew the local Mexican government and declared the California Republic, ushering in the American Conquest of California.

## Sonoma Plaza

Sonoma Plaza [Spanish: Plaza de Sonoma] is the central plaza of Sonoma, California. The plaza, the largest in California,was laid out in 1835 by Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, founder of Sonoma.

This plaza is surrounded by many historical buildings, including the Mission San Francisco Solano, Captain Salvador Vallejo's Casa Grande, the Presidio of Sonoma, the Blue Wing Inn, and the Toscano Hotel. In the middle of the plaza, Sonoma's early 20th-century city hall, at the plaza's center and still in use, was designed and built with four identical sides in order not to offend the merchants on any one side of the plaza. The plaza is a National Historic Landmark[2] and still serves as the town's focal point, hosting many community festivals and drawing tourists all year round. It provides a central tourist attraction. "The Plaza", as it is known, is the site of a huge Fourth of July celebration, with thousands of the town's inhabitants attending the festivities. It is also the location of the Farmer's Market, held every Tuesday in the summer.
