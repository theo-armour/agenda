"I opened Jacuzzi Family Vineyards in 2007 to honor my beloved grandfather Valeriano Jacuzzi. As a teenager and young man, my grandfather taught me how to tease magic from the soil. The stonework and design of the Jacuzzi Family Vineyards and The Olive Press building is a tribute to our Jacuzzi family home in Casarsa, Italy." — Fred Cline

## FROM ITALY TO AMERICA
The Jacuzzi trek to America started in 1907, when Fred Cline's grandfather Valeriano and his brother emigrated to work on the railroad. A warmer climate beckoned and he eventually made his way to southern California. Years later, they were joined by their four brothers and all worked in the aviation industry. Soon they would make history. In 1911, Fred's great grandfather, Giovanni a skilled woodworker and vineyard farmer, joined his sons. Two weeks was enough to convince him that they would remain in California. Valeriano and Giovanni returned to Italy to gather up the remaining family but World War I intervened and their trip was delayed.

## INVENTORS
During his time in Italy, Valeriano met Giuseppina, fell in love and married. In 1920, he, his new wife and the remaining Jacuzzi family emigrated to America. At that time, Valeriano joined his brothers and worked at their Jacuzzi Brothers factory where they built the first enclosed cabin high-wing monoplane. A tragic crash, in Modesto, of Jacuzzi’s plane took several lives, including that of Valeriano’s brother, Giocondo. Giovanni asked his sons to cease making planes.

## FARMING
Valeriano moved his family to Northern California and purchased a 161-acre farm in Contra Costa County. During the depression, he along with help from his older children, planted a portion of the open farm fields with grapes and in 1936 applied for a license to make wine for home consumption. At that time, production was limited to 200 gallons (approximately 84 cases). The vineyard was planted to Zinfandel, Carignane and Mourvèdre. He sold grapes for $30-$35 a ton. In 1937, Valeriano returned to work with his brothers at Jacuzzi Brothers, Inc. located in Berkeley, CA where they manufactured water well pumps and eventually, the bath and spa that bears their name.
