Hello Randy

Or to our lunch today. I'm sure we won't have the time, but here's some items that if we did have the time, I would like to discuss some observations:

## 100th Anniversary of the Morgan Building.
2025 will be the hundredth year of the completion of the Judy Morgan Building. I would like to help the residents and other interested parties to plan ways of celebrating this historical event In the life of our community. As with so many other aspects. Comma given the The very advanced average age of residents and the heavy workload of current team members, finding people to help is not easy.

## Building and grounds committee
We residents should be excellent eyes and ears For helping team members Identify monitor The status of the building and grounds. There are numerous instances where simple minor fixes could make the property a more attractive place to prospective residents. I have several years tried to start a "House committee" unsuccessfully. Does the board have anything like this in mind? I'm not talking about the strategic plan. At all, but the big condition of the current infrastructure.

## Informing Residents of The Board of directors Activities
As a resident of Heritage on the Marina, I feel surprisingly uninformed about the activities of the board of directors. I don't think I'm alone.

These are merely observations, But I hope they are worthy of some discussion sometime. .

Looking forward to dining with you today.,

Theo
