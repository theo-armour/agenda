# 2023-11-07 Charlie Dicke Meetup

## Initial reason for meeting

-   Initial meeting was Tony hounding and baiting Mary so hard that she left the meeting
-   One of the residents reported: "As Mary left the building she said 'I'm never coming back here again"
-   Situation has calmed down a lot, but I still feel that this talk will help
-   There are underlying issue; it would be great if they could be addressed

## Preface

-   My personal life: All good: Family, location, fitness, diet, sleep, social, mental, spiritual, financial
-   Heritage life \#1: I'm having a great time, a ton of fun, learning a lot
-   Heritage life \#2: For a number of residents there are issues; I'm here to help

For most residents, life here is amazingly good, but:

-   Personality conflicts
-   Mis-communication
-   less than perfect: health services and maintenance

## Residents

-   Extremely aged cohort, cannot rely on for anything
-   Unprepared for change, very concerned, some stressed
-   Minimal understanding or comprehension of the Strategic Plan, financial situation or condition of physical plant
-   Serious contingent of anti-Mary residents
-   Sadly: most residents have little or no concept that they are part of a 170-year charitable legacy

## Admin Directors

-   Overworked, under supported
-   Mary: speaks too fast, not touchy-feely
-   Jeff: over promises, under delivers
-   Karina: not enough time, not enough support
-   Jon: MIA
-   Praveen: ??
-   All: smart, hearts in good places

## Services & Staff

-   Dining, Housekeeping, Maintenance: 5 stars
-   Health Services, Activities, Accounting: ??

## Process & Procedures

-   Ongoing process & procedures appear to be almost non-existent
-   Writing and keeping records is not part of the skill set
-   No one knows what is going on
-   Of course, there are a ton of forms to submit to agencies

## Observations: There are a ton of issues

-   Staff, facilities, health services, accounting, IT, web site, communications, emergency management, etc.
-   Campus facilities: So many issues, it hard to know where to start
-   Health Services: We lost a perfectly good director, we have no idea why. Was was the nature of the conflict
-   Aging in place: people have no idea what the plan is
-   Residents Council: currently useless
-   Mary on leave of absence may be helping calm things

## Possibilities

-   Join with larger organization
-   Employ a touchy-feely person, "facilitator"

## Questions

-   What can I do to help?
-   How can I be good eyes and ears for the Board?
-   Difficult question: What can the Board do to help?

## Notes

-   I will run for a position on the Board in 2024
