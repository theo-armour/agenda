# Tips

Can you test the Internet speed in the various affected locations?
Go to https://fast.com on your phone and wait for the updates to stop.
My phone reports over 80 megabits per second. My computer reports over 90 MBS.
Any reports less than 25 MBS would like result in lousy Zoom connections.
If your phone reports good connection speeds then the culprit is likely to be older devices not capable of handling the available bandwidth.
In that case, you should turn off the camera and mike on your computer and just watch and listen.
