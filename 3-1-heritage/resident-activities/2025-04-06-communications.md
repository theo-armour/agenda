Hi Mary

Thank you for your considered thoughts, in particular:

>> we need to reconsider how we do this so people can get the paper copies they want and need and the digital stuff they want and need. I think it’s Going to be a beast to figure all that out and I’m not sure we have the staffing to manage the process. But know that we are a team together, and we can solve this and work through it together

Teaming together would be good. 

It would be easy to maintain a spreadsheet that lists individual preferences for every resident, for every type of communication.

A benefit of a spreadsheet like this would be that it would tell the Front Office how many copies to print out, instead of printing 30 copies but putting them in only 25 mailboxes. 

The spreadsheet could be in a heritage sharepoint folder and accessible by team members and designated residents. 

This and many more communications issues could be resolved gently and bit by bit by an ongoing communications committee with both team members and capable residents as members of the committee.

If anybody is interested, I can propose the next few steps to get this process started.
