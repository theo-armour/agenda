# Margaret Johnson

You are one of my best drinking buddies.

Yes, we both like to drink a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and a cheese crisp or two before dinner.

But there's more. Why? My top ten reasons

Because you:

* Created things with your hands ~ pies, pates, microscope slides, Duncan's shirts
* A mender and fixer of worn and broken things ~ think of all those books you fixed in your workshop
* An eye for detail - calligraphy, photography, drawings ~ you apartment walls are full of examples
* A diarist ~ writing journals copious note of your houses and travels
* A raconteur of tales of places and travels ~ mostly of good relationships ~ priestr in Iowa, pathologist and family in Barcelona
* A collector of things that were made by hand ~ boxes, books, earings like little books
* A traveler ~ not just holidays ~ not afraid to live in new places ~ twenty houses
* A maintainer of history and heritage ~ each of your houses has a story
* A reader of book club books ~ read and discuss the story
* All in all, a friendly, non-judgmental person of enthusiasm, curiosity and energy

Here's the thing: Your energy doesn't stop

* You are probably the most productive writer for the Heritage Happenings monthly newsletter
* Over the past two years you have provided more text and photos than any other writer
* Not only that: Your writing gets better, improving with age
* You are starting to add new twists to old stories
* Your recent writing reflects aspects of the #MeToo movement
* When writing of your past, you are beginning to add trenchant yet discrete observations of the role of women in a highly patriarchal society
* Elements rarely seen in your earlier stories ~ let alone in the Heritage Happenings

I propose a toast, that we raise our glasses to a woman of many talents

to a woman whose talents are still growing, engaging and thoughtful

To Margaret, my drinking buddy!
