# Margaret Johnson


* One of my best drinking buddies

Why? My top ten reasons

Because you:

* Created things with her hands ~ pies, pates, Duncan's shirts
* A mender and fixer of worn and broken things ~ think of all those books she fixed
* An eye for detail - calligraphy, photography, drawings ~ her walls are full of example
* A diarist ~ writing copious note of your houses and travels
* A raconteur of tales of places and travels ~ mostly of good relations ships ~
* A collector of things that were made by hand ~ boxes, books, jewelry
* A traveler ~ not afraid to live in new places ~ twenty houses
* A maintainer of history and heritage ~ each of your houses has a story
* A reader of book club books ~ read and discuss the story
* A friendly, non-judgmental person of enthusiasm

It doesn't stop

* Probably the the productive write for the Heritage Happenings monthly newsletter
* Text and photos
* writing gets better
* A new twist to old stories
* Her recent writing reflects aspects of the #MeToo movement
* When writing of her past, she is beginning to add observations of the role of women in a highly patriarchal society
*

Toast to a woman of many talents, whose talents are still growing, engaging and thoughtful
