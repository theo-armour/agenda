Hello Amy and Joe

This is a bit late, nonetheless, this is to offer my thanks for a delightful day in a beautiful setting with most excellent beef at the Baumgartner Ranch.

I hope you both received my email with your copies of the Heritage Happenings. There is a two page spread on the excursion at the back of the newsletter.

Question: a while ago, many residents signed two cards of thanks for our visit. Also several residents sent individual cards. It appears that Anne has not received them. Would they have been sent to either or both of you?

Stop by for a meal sometime. Many residents would be pleased to see you and say hello. Seeing and interacting with the children of fellow residents that we so often hear about is a real treat.

Stay well! And thanks again for a wonderful day!

Theo
