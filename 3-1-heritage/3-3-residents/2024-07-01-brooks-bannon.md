>I felt like I was talking with Leon Trotsky in the years before the Russian Revolution.

>I was sitting in Steve Bannon’s Washington living room in 2019. His stint in Donald Trump’s White House had ended ingloriously, but he had resumed his self-appointed role as populism’s grand strategist, its propagandist, its bad-boy visionary. He sat there that day sketching out his plans for how MAGA-type movements could take over the world.

In general, I find the right wing quite difficult to understand. I do not move in their circles. And it is difficult to understand people You don't mix with. Much of my understanding comes from. Left wing reporters reporting on the right wing. Which again is a questionable source at best.

I was quite struck by reading David Brooks's interview with Steve Bannon published this morning.

In no way do I agree with Bannon's views, but I find his manner of speaking dynamic, captivating And persuasive. I can see why he has amassed such a large audience for his podcasts and radio shows.

Maybe January 6th was only the beginning...
