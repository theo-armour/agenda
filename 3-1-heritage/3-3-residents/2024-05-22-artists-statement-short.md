## Personal Background

Until I was sent to boarding school at age 12, I frequently made drawings—maps of Robinson Crusoe's Island, side views of battleships, tanks and bombers, castles and fortresses, and—a crowd pleaser—side view of JEEPs outfitted to carry everything needed for a picnic.

I never happily carry a sketchbook and sketch a building or a cityscape. I an envious of those who do. I have always been a technical draftsman, not an artist. Some of my excuses:

◯ Drawing in a sketchbook is hard with just one hand<br>
◯ It takes time and many fails to create a good sketch.<br>
◯ A drawing is a representation of something. I want to design the "something" rather than sit around trying to figure out how to represent it.

I started the exercise in August 2020 and continued until 2022. The Coco Channel suit was the first drawing.

## Themes

The drawings tended to follow themes. Themes include:

## Birthdays

On resident birthdays, I asked the resident what drawing they would like to see. Then I repeatedly drew the item until there were the number of items corresponding to the age of the resident.

## Artists Coloring Books

Examples: Bourgeois, Hepworth and Giacometti drawings.

### People Wearing Sombreros

Sometimes, I was lazy and ripped off the idea from the book _CéKoiCa?! - C'est un Mexicain qui..._.

## Single Line Drawings
I have always been fascinated by Picasso's single-line drawings. I emulated this style in several drawings.

## Why Did I Start Drawing?

I created these images to provide residents passing through the corridor with something to smile at during the long, lonely pandemic isolation. All of these drawings took effort on my part, They were another failed attempt to see if I could develop paper drawing skills in ways that gratify me. Yet, in many ways, I have not stopped. I just focus on other things. I am always a designer and a developer. Computers are my medium. Fingers crossed: They will pull the keyboard out of my cold dead hand.

## The Future

I dream of finding collaborators for the creation, display and enjoyment of images and 3D interactive designs on the Internet. My hero, Picasso, invented new ways of using your eyes. I believe his efforts can be updated, extrapolated and extended into models for the future of art. I want to be part of that future.
