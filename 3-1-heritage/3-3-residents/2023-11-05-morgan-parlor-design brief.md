# 2023-11-05 Morgan Parlor Design Brief

Hello residents

Many of you have signed Margaret Jacobs "Letter to Administration" petition to "return the Morgan Parlor to a configuration that restores the homelike warmth and invitation to use..."

As an agendum to the petition I have prepared a "design brief" that outlines possible design goals and objectives for the Morgan Parlor.  I have attached it to this email.

I look forward to your comments and suggestions.
