Bernie Burke

One cannot start talking about Bernie without bringing up Eleanor. They were a team.

I'm sure many of us Will say that Eleanor was the dynamic and outgoing team member.

In my analysis, Bernie was just as outgoing and dynamic as Eleanor. He was just more subtle about it.

For decades, Bernie worked in wealth management. Bernie had decades experience as a "customer's man". A "customer's man" is a term primarily used in the context of the stock exchange and financial services. It refers to a registered representative who buys and sells securities and manages client accounts.

The primary task as a "customer's man is to keep the client happy. Bernie was a master at keeping the happiness going. Let me tell you how he did it.

When you are in the room with the client and there is negotiation going on, Bernie would be the one to make sure the conversation was going in the right direction. He did this by maintaining an extraordinary repertoire of anecdotes. And very important each anecdote was relevant to the conversation and finished with an uplifting message.

Let me give some examples.

One summer when he was a student at Stanford, he was a lifeguard at the Bohemian Club Summer Grove. Most of the time was spent cleaning up the beach. But one day some of the members were looking for a fourth for a bridge game. Bernie was the fourth. He was the youngest by 30 years. And he hot to play bridge with Chief Justice Earl Warren.

When he has in high school, he and some friends were hiking in a forest above Lake Tahoe. The came across a deserted cabin. But it was just any deserted cabin. Inside there was the actual diary of the people who built the cabin.

When he was in the Navy, he was stationed in Alameda. One day a pilot asked Bernie if he wanted to go for a ride. Bernie said yes. The pilot took Bernie for a ride. The ride included flying under the Golden Gate Bridge.

When Bernie and Eleanor went to Oslo they didn't stay just anywhere, by some stroke of luck they stayed at the same hotel as the Nobel Prize winners - and giot upgraded to the suite that was reserved for the Nobel Prize winners.

My favorite story is when Fred and Laon were back in Vietnam. One of the dozen eggs that had arrived from the market cracked open and a duckling came out. Well the duckling became "Ping the Duck" and ever hafter whenever Bernia and Eleanor came back from Vietnam we had to know how Ping was doing. And Ping is alive to this day.

And the stories go on and on.

Eleanor painted images with her water colors. Bernie painted stories with his anecdotes. Together they were a team. Together they were a remarkable force. Together they were a joy to be around.
