Hi Carolyn

Below is a link to the newsletter. 

March Heritage Happenings
https://heritage-happenings.github.io/happenings-issues/2025/2025-03-happenings-newsletter.pdf

I hope you will send the link to your mother. This year we are working on a monthly series regarding wellness. See below.

I would be delighted to have your mother as a contributing writer. Her geriatric and gerontology experience could be very informative. We have no residents with such skills here.

Health & Wellness Topic of the Month

1. January ~ Exercise (Mental & Physical)
2. February ~ Sleep
3. March ~ Eating Well & Hydration
4. April ~ Healthy Relationships (with Yourself & Others)
5. May ~ Socializing
6. June ~ Hobbies, Passions, Inspiration
7. July ~ Financial Fitness
8. August ~ Advanced Planning
9. September ~ Fall Prevention
10. October ~ Medication Management
11. November ~ Community Engagement
12. December ~ Your Legacy

The process for selecting these topics was kind of just brainstorming by my niece and me. It would be nice to follow suit with some larger organization' research on relevant topics.
