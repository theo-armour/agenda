Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Sherrill, Members of the Board of Directors, distinguished resident and team members, and fellow citizens.

Two years ago we celebrated in this parlor the 170th anniversary of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society - the second oldest charitable organization in the city.

Today, we gather to honor the 100th anniversary of the Julia Morgan Building, the Society's enduring gift to the city.

The Society has a history of employing the most illustrious architects of their day. In 1923, they commissioned Julia Morgan to design a building that would serve as a home for the elderly and infirm. 

Julia Morgan, designer of San SimeoÃÅn, the Hearst Castle, and the Fairmont Hotel, responsible for over 750 projects, continues to be the most prolific architect ever in American history.

Even so, I  want to suggest that the Julia Morgan Building is one of her loveliest efforts.

This is not easy as it sounds. Although we know a fair amount about her personal life, she was reticent about her work. She left no memoirs, no diaries. She gave few interviews. As she said: "My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone."

The question at hand is: What is this building saying?

It's a building that like buildings built in England during the time of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth.


 Built with brick, terracotta, and slate, 

it's adorned with Tudor roses - symbols of love. It's a building that's earthquake-resilient, reinforced-concrete structure. It's a building that's a Jacobean Revival building.
