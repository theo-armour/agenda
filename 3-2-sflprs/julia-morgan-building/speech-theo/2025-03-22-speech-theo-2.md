Salutations Mayor Lurie.

Greetings Supervisor Sherrill



Welcome Randy

Howdy Board of Directors, distinguished residents, team members, and fellow citizens,

You have walked past or even inside this building countless times. 

But have you ever - truly - looked at it?

My goal today is to reveal to you the secrets of this Julia Morgan Building

Before we explore the architecture, let’s step back into history

Two years ago, we celebrated in this parlor,

the 170th anniversary of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society — the second oldest charitable organization in the city.

Today, we convene to honor the Society's enduring gift to our fair city. 

We celebrate the 100th anniversary of the opening of Julia Morgan Building, 

Not surprisingly, the Society has a history of employing the most illustrious architects of the day. 

In 1922, the Society commissioned Julia Morgan to design a mansion to serve as a home for the elderly and infirm.

Julia Morgan — best known for Hearst Castle — designed hundreds of buildings,
yet she rarely spoke of her work

As she said: "My buildings will be my legacy... 
they will speak for me — long after I'm gone."

As a phenomenal "Building whisperer", what is Julia telling us?

What secrets is this mansion whispering 
as we walk by?

Well, the style is Tudor Revival, constructed with brick, terracotta, and slate 
- just like the sixteenth century English manor houses.

The decorations therefore 
are more than just aesthetic; 
they carry historic meaning. 

Such decorations are symbols that speak to people.

Let's take a closer look.

Just above the front door, there are two shields. Unadorned. Just shields.

Well, why do you carry a shield? 
To protect yourself, of course.

What is the name of the organization that built this building? 

The shields whisper the answer 
"The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society"

The largest decorations are two large terracotta panels on both wings of the second floor. 

Each plaque contains three images of a special flower - the Tudor Rose.

This rose symbolizes the end of the War of the Roses, uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster.

Looking around, you can see these roses repeated in at least twenty different ways - in dozens of locations

After you’ve soaked in the exterior details, step inside…

There are four roses on the mantlepiece in the parlor 
and four more roses on the altar in the chapel.

So why does Julia obsess on the rose? 
What is she whispering?

The rose is an ancient symbol of love.

What do you send to someone you love on Valentines Day? A dozen roses!

In designing this home for women in need, 
Julia Morgan wrapped them — and us — 
in a quiet message of safety, comfort, and love.

The panels with three roses?

Three roses often stands for three words "I love you"

And indeed, these words resonate to this day

I hope you will gp up to the art gallery on the second floor.

There's an exhibit on the history of the building and the art of its residents.

The exhibit is a love letter to the building.

From a community filled with love.

Julia is still speaking to us.

You are in a building surrounded by symbols of love.

Not just on the front facade but on every wall

Julia is whispering, 
"You are standing in one of my loveliest buildings in San Francisco"

Let us return the compliment.

Let us speak to Julia.

Kindly raise your glasses.

To Julia Morgan! We love you!
