Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Sherrill, Members of the Board of Directors, distinguished resident and team members, and fellow citizens.

You have most likely passed by this building a zillion times. You may have even entered it. But have you ever really looked at it?

My goal here to reveal to you the secrets of the Julia Morgan Building.

It's a story with a long history.

Two years ago we celebrated in this parlor the 170th anniversary of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society - the second oldest charitable organization in the city.

Today, we gather to honor the 100th anniversary of the Julia Morgan Building, the Society's enduring gift to the city.

Not really a secret, The Society has a history of employing the most illustrious architects of their day. In 1923, they commissioned Julia Morgan to design a building that would serve as a home for the elderly and infirm. 

Julia Morgan, designer of San SimeoÃÅn, the Hearst Castle, and the Fairmont Hotel, responsible for over 750 projects, continues to be the most prolific architect ever in American history.

Even so, I want to suggest - the secret I want to share - that the Julia Morgan Building is one of her loveliest efforts.

This is not easy as it sounds. Although we know a fair amount about her personal life, she was reticent about her work. She left no memoirs, no diaries. She gave few interviews. As she said: "My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone."

The question at hand is: What is Julia this building telling? What secrets is it whispering as we walk by

It's a building that like buildings built in England during the time of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth.


It's built with brick, terracotta, and slate

And like quality buildings of that time, is has what we moderns would decorations.

Back in the day, the decorations had meanings. They stood for something. They were symbols. They talked to you.

The cross stands for christianity, the star of David for Judaism, the crescent for Islam.

Well what out this building. the landmark designation documents admire the "floral decorations" on the building.

But what if Julia is trying to talk to us? What if she's trying to tell us something? With the decorations.

Let's double click into this.

In the past five fears I've walked arounf this building a lot.

Just above the outside front door, there's are two shields. Unadorned. Just shields.

Why do you carry a shield? To protect yourself, of course. What is the name of the organization that built this building? The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.

The biggest decoration is the two large terracotta panels on the second floor above the two bay windows to each side. Each one contains three images of a flower. What flower? 

This is a tudor revival building. The Tudors were the English royal family from 1485 to 1603.

The Tudor rose is the traditional floral heraldic emblem of England and takes its name and origins from the Tudor dynasty.

The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster.

There was a war between the two houses. The War of the Roses. The Tudor rose symbolized the end of the war. The union of the two houses.

These are definitely look like tudor roses. Except they have either four sides instead of the traditional five. But they are definitely roses.

looking around the building, there are at least twenty different places where you can see these roses. Even indoors. There are four on the fireplace in the parlor. And four more on the alter in the chapel.

So why did Julia obsess over a rose.

The rose is a an ancient symbol of love. 

Depictions Aphrodite / Venus / Virgin Mary

Valentines cards / Burns My love is like a red red rose

You are in a building surrounded symbols of love.

Julia was designing a building for destitute and incapacitated women. She wants you to feel safe and comforted.

The panels with three roses? Three roses stands for the words "I love you."

Guess what? It works. 

Go up the the art gallery on the second floor. There's an exhibit of the history of the life of the building and the art of the residents. It's a love letter to the building. From a community filled with love.

Julia is still speaking to us. 

Let us return the compliment. Please raise your glasses.

Julia Morgan! We love you!

or

Yay Julia!
