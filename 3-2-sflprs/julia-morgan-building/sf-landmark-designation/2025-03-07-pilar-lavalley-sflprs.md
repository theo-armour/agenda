Dear Ms LaValley

My message relates to San Francisco Landmark 320 relating to the property at 34500 Laguna Street.

My first comment is to express my gratitude and appreciation for the work of the San Francisco Planning Department in designating the Julia Morgan Building  Designated Landmark. The designation is a recognition of the importance of the property and the work of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.

My second comment is to request that the text relating to the text be updated to reflect the actual name of the organization. I refer to the text at displayed at the San Francisco Planning Department website at:

https://sfplanning.org/project/designated-landmarks-and-landmark-districts#designated-landmarks

The current text reads:

>The former Ladies’ Protection and Relief Society is significant for association with San Francisco’s second-oldest charitable organization and the first to be established by and for women.

Please note two things:

1. The society is not "former" but very alive and kicking
2. The legal name of the organization is the "San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society"

Would you kindly help me locate the person or persons who could make the necessary updates to the text?

I would be pleased to assist in any way I can and would be happy to provide any additional corroboration you may require.

First, I would like to express my gratitude to the San Francisco Planning Department for designating the Julia Morgan Building as a Designated Landmark. This recognition highlights both the property’s significance and the important work of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.

Second, may I request that the text on the Planning Department’s website be updated to reflect the correct name of the organization. Currently, the text displayed at:
