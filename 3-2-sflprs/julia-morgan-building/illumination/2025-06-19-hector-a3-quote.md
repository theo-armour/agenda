Hello Hector

https://a3visual.com/

A3 is the company that sent me the quote. A copy of their quote is attached.

A3 seem to be the top people in this industry. The quote is way out of our league: $800K++ for a permanent installation. Nonetheless, it shows us that there people who can do this sort of thing- and there are likely to be cheaper alternatives. 

There are other players. Some may be a lot cheaper. Here are three in the Bay Area:

* https://got-light.com/
* https://www.ejalighting.com/
* https://lumenandforge.com/

My gut says it would be possible to get a custom-designed light system that has these capabilities for $100K or less:

* Good effects, makes the Julia Morgan Building stand out 
* Does not shine in any windows
* Has a good lifetime expectancy

If you think it's a good idea, I will contact these vendors and obtain quotes from them. I will start asking for quotes in the $50K-$75K region. I would prepare a specification of requirements to send out and pass it by you first. I will copy you on any messages. I will always state that I am a resident and not an employee.

If you have any suggested vendors, I would be please to contact them as well. 

What do you think?

Cheers,

Theo
