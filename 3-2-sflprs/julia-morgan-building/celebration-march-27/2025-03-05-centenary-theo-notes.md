# 2025-03-05 Julia Morgan Building ~ Centenary Celebration ~ Theo Armour Notes

## Julia Morgan Building Historic Landmark Plaque

Mary confirmed yesterday that production of a plaque is underway.

The plaque will be eventually placed on the facade of the building facing Laguna Street.

Suggestion: The leading visiting dignitary should be invited to receive the unmounted plaque and hold it up in the air. This being a nice photo opportunity.

## Visual Presentation During the Centenary Celebration

Now that I have access to the blueprints of Julia Morgan's drawings and many other sources, I can begin prepare a visual presentation for the centenary celebration. This would be a looping slide show of images projected on a screen.

Soon I will try out using my projector to see how the images look when projected onto the ceiling at various locations in the Morgan Parlor.

* The ceiling would provide a nice white screen for the projection.
* The slides would be visible to all in the room.
* There would be get in the way in a very crowded space.
* The would be no screen to set up and take down.

I will report back on the results of this experiment.

If worse come to worse, the Zoon screen can be used.
