# 2025-02-25 My Speech


Julia Morgan: Architecture is a visual art, and the buildings speak for themselves.

What is this building saying?

This building is covered in roses.

What is Julia Morgan saying with these symbols?

// I don't think she is refering to the War or the Roses or Henry the 8th

So what does a rose symbolize?

My conjecture: I have no evidence

The rose is a symbol of love

Aphrodite / Venus / Virgib Mary

Valentines cards / Burns My live is like e red red rose

You are in a building covered in symbols of love

Julia Morgan is speaking throught her building

She wanted the destitute ladies who came to this building to feel 

safe andcomforted

So what is the take-away from my little talk

You are in the loveliest and loving building in this city

Julia Morgan: Let us return the compliment. Please raise your glasses

Julia Morgan we love you!
