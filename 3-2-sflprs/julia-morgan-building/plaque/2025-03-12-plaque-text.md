# 2025-03-12 Plaque Text

Hello Mary

I understand progress is being made with the San Francisco Landmark Plaque. I thought it a good idea to revisit the number of words for the text. I created a mockup that allow for 36pt font size for the body text within an internal plaque radius of sixteen inches for the body text. My eyeballs say that the current text with 104 words is too much. 

So just-in-case, I have a revised text with 88 words. I hope this helps. See below.

Commissioned by San Francisco Ladies Protection
and Relief Society and opened in 1925, this
Jacobean Revival building was designed by
AIA Gold Medal architect Julia Morgan.

A brick, terracotta, and slate exterior, adorned 
with Tudor rosesâ€”symbols of love, encases an 
earthquake resilient reinforced concrete structure.

Today, as Heritage on the Marina, the premises serve
as a retirement community. Its expansive gardens and
timeless design embodies an historic legacy of charity
and architectural significance, offering a serene
and graceful setting for residents and team members.
