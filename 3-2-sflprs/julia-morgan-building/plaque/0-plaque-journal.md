## Hi Mary

I had eight plaques. Now I have three.

I am quite certain the following people have received their plaques:

* Frankie for Stefani
* Laura for Pelosi
* Carolyn Kiernat
* Randy Gridley
* Woody LaBounty

My guess is that Sherrill, you, Margaret Johnson, a team member and I have have not received your plaques.

Does that sound right?

Hello South Bay Bronze

What is a ballpark figure for the cost and delivery time for a typical circular bronze plaque for a San Francisco Historic Landmark?
