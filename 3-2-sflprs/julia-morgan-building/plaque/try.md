Commissioned by San Francisco Ladies Protection
and Relief Society and opened in 1925, this
Jacobean Revival building was designed by
AIA Gold Medal architect Julia Morgan,
An earthquake resilient reinforced concrete structure
showcases a blend of brick, terracotta, and slate,
adorned with Tudor rosesâ€”symbols of love and protection.
Today, as Heritage on the Marina, the premises serve 
as a retirement community. Its expansive gardens and 
timeless design embody an historic legacy of charity 
and architectural significance, offering a serene
and graceful setting for residents and team members.
