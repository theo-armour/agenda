* I moved to Heritage on the Marina in 2020 at the height of the virus. As a one-handed paraplegic, I was looking for a safe place to live. 
Five years later, it turns out that I'm at one of the happiest moments in my life. 
One of the youngest here, On of the happiest moments of limy life, Please can I still be here ten years from now?

## Beyond NIMBYism: Residents Supporting Real Solutions

**• Attractive, affordable senior communities** are essential for San Francisco's aging population

**• Aging in your house** Where one or two people occupy large family homes—wastes precious housing stock**

**• Senior housing** frees up larger properties for younger families who desperately need them

**• This fight is worth it** I'm personally willing to give up my stunning view of Fort Mason and the Bay

**• Noise and Dust** Yes, there will be noise and dust during construction

**• We residents will be living at ground zero** We are deeply concerned about impacts

**• We're fully committed to solutions**: our Board of Directors and contractors have made air quality and noise abatement the top priority

**• Call to Action**

* We are not asking you to solve the housing crisis overnight
* we are asking you to say yes when your own constituents step up with real solutions.
