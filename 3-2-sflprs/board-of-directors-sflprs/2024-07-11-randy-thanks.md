Hi Randy

Thank you for our good lunch yesterday. You handled being pulled into multiple directions with grace and good humor. For sure I was hard on Doris. She is my next door neighbor and we get along very well. I am sure she will forgive me.

A point you made that resonated with me was that the target profile for new residents is one of people of advanced ageâ€”very often with some impairments <my words not yours>.

The likelihood for good numbers "youngsters" like me is quite unlikely in the future. In other words, the prospect for even a small number of residents that have the drive and ability to be active in the community is quite low.

Nonetheless, I am a resident that does have the drive and ability to be active in the community, but find few opportunities for doing so.

Interacting with team members is is interesting. Team members tend to rely on residents for as little input as possible. Why? To make a long story short: Residents tend to kick the bucket or develop issues. Whenever that happens, the likelihood of finding a replacement for that skill among the remaining residents is unlikely. Ditto reliance on any volunteers, I understand and accept that.

So, finding opportunities for me being useful to this community have been slim.

I like your idea of planning a Morgan building centenary celebration in conjunction with Patti. She has a deep connection to the history of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.  Short term resident and team member collaborations have worked in the past. I would be delighted to be part of such an effort.
