Tighten:

Bullet points for my talk to The San Francisco Board of Supervisors tomorrow:

* Attractive, affordable retirement communities for the elderly are a San Francisco necessity. 
* Aging in your house model, where one or two people rattle around in a big old house, is not an engaging future. 
* Senior Housing  Releases larger properties for use by younger families 
* It's worth a fight.
  * I'm will give up my stunning view of Fort Mason & the Bay. 
* Noise and Dust? 
  * We residents will be living at Ground Zero
  * Just imagine how concerned we are
  * We committed: ur 
    * Board of Directors and all the contractors
    * Top priority: Air quality and noise abatement

**• Attractive, affordable senior communities** are essential for San Francisco's aging population

**• Aging in your house** where one or two people occupy large family homes—wastes precious housing stock**

**• Senior housing** frees up larger properties for younger families who desperately need them

**• This fight is worth it** I'm personally willing to give up my stunning view of Fort Mason and the Bay

**• Noise and Dust** Yes, there will be noise and dust during construction

**• We residents will be living at ground zero** We are deeply concerned about impacts

**• We're fully committed to solutions**: our Board of Directors and contractors have made air quality and noise abatement the top priority

**• Call to Action**
* We are not asking you to solve the housing crisis overnight
* we are asking you to say yes when your own constituents step up with real solutions.
