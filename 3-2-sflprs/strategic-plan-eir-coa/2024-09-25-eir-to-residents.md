Hello Heritage Residents,

San Francisco Government TV/ https://sanfrancisco.granicus.com/player/camera/8

The public hearing at City Hall for the draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for 3400 Laguna is scheduled for Thursday, September 26, starting at noon. The link above will take you to the live stream of the meeting.

The EIR is a comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the proposed plan and is required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

Today's meeting is about the first draft. The discussion will be highly technical and procedural. I asked Randy Gridley, Chairman of the Board, about attending. He kindly responded as follows

Hi Theo,

As per our discussion while we are happy to have residents attend the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) meeting at City Hall this Thursday, it is not really necessary. The EIR Review is a process the City goes through to assess the potential environmental impact of any building project in San Francisco County, residential or commercial. In our case an EIR is not required unless specifically requested but we have decided to ask for one anyway just to help make sure we are being thorough in all our planning. Our land use attorney has submitted a detailed report for the Committee’s review which as you know has been posted online. The purpose of the meeting next Thursday is to allow any interested parties to weigh in on whether the facts related to the environmental impact report submitted are complete and if there are additional environmental related items that should be added for consideration. This is not related to the approval of the project, it’s just about making sure that all the potential environmental impacts are being considered. The EIR Review Board will then decide if they need additional information from us for their analysis. A final approval of the ERI, and possible additional open hearing, won’t be done until late this year or early next year. Based on our location and relatively straightforward plan we don’t anticipate any major environment concerns.

We very much appreciate any Residents who want to participate in supporting approval of the project but since the meeting Thursday is only about the opportunity to make sure all the potential environmental issues are on the table, I don’t think this is a critical meeting. Regardless, as with all these meetings, all are welcome to attend if they are curious about the process. We’ll be in touch as we approach more critical hearings to keep you posted on what’s ahead.

Best Regards,

Randy
