On September 26 at City Hall, the San Francisco Planning Commission is holding a public hearing to discuss the draft Heritage on the MarinaE EIR.

For we who are residents of HotM who plan to attend and to speak at the meeting, what should our role be?

Personally and as a proponent of the Strategic Plan, I will speak to the following points:

I am drafting my points so as to be entirely within the scope and terms of the EIR.

## Summary

## Table S-3 ~ Summary of Impacts of the 3400 Laguna Street Project Identified in the Initial Study ~ page S-9

### Section SE.4 Cultural Resources ~ Initial Study Section E.4

During the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, the campus was the site of the two commercial attractions: A replica of the Grand Canyon and a stationary submarine ride.

Any monitoring of the construction process should be done with an eye to the preservation of any artifacts that may be uncovered that might relate to these unexpected and incongruous artifacts.


### Section E.6 ~Transportation and Circulation ~ page S-24

Impacts TR-1,2,3

The proposed project will have a significant beneficial impact on the accessibility and walkability of the neighborhood. Residents, workers will have safer access to the build by having sidewalks rather than a parking lot to walk through. The distance to get to the Fort Mason meadow will be shorter, safer and more direct

### Section E.7 Noise ~ page S-25

Impact NO-1

Moving the generator to the interior of the building will reduce the noise impact on the neighborhood. The generator will be less likely to be heard by the residents of the Marina District.

### Section E.8 Air Quality ~ page S-32

Impacts AQ-1 to AQ-5

Moving the generator to the interior of the building and renovating kitchen facilities to be more energy efficient will reduce the air quality impacts of the project. The generator will be less likely to emit pollutants that will affect the air quality of the Marina District.

### Section E.10 Wind ~ page 33

Impacts WI-1 C-WI-1:

Currently, the courtyard and the Rose Fox Knoll Garden is a wind tunnel. The proposed project may help mitigate this impact by adding a windbreak to the courtyard. This will reduce the wind tunnel effect and make the courtyard more pleasant for residents and workers.

Wind mitigation in these areas should a priority for the project.


### Section E.15, Biological Resources ~ page S-36

Impacted BI-1

Better exterior waste management will reduce by scavengers such as coyotes and raccoons

## Chapter 2

### 2.D.2 Proposed Renovations to Julia Morgan and Perry Buildings

An interior character defining feature that is not-self evident. Unlike most main lobbies of building in 1925, the main is without any decoration. All we see are plain columns and beams. These are evidence that the building is made of reinforced concrete. You are entering a building that is designed to be earthquake resistent—a hallmark of Julia Morgan's architecture. This is a feature that should be preserved.


## Chapter 3. Environmental Setting, Impacts, and Mitigation Measures

### Criterion 1: Associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of California’s History and Cultural Heritage (Events) ~ page 3.B13

Not mentioned: The project was a significant Part of the Marina District Redevelopment after the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition closed down. Much of the development was in Art Deco. Julia Morgan's design follows a very different trajectory. See also below.

### Criterion 2: Associated with lives of persons important in our past (Persons).

See the list of many notable people associated with Heritage on the Marina in my draft article for wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:San_Francisco_Ladies_Protection_and_Relief_Society


### Criterion 3: Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or represents the work of an important creative individual, or possesses high artistic values (Architecture).

For sure

### Criterion 4: Has yielded or may be likely to yield, information in prehistory or history (Information Potential).

## Character-Defining Features 15 ~ page 3.B-15

* Terra Cotta details with representations of a Tudor rose—a symbol of love—evident in twelve different manners (or more) and in dozens of locations throughout the building
* Unencumbered, undecorated reinforced concrete structure evident in the main lobby

### Adjacent Historic Architectural Resources

According to the HRR,17 the project site is in the Marina neighborhood. Across Laguna Street to the west, the 3400 Laguna Street property faces the Moscone Recreation Center that contains the article 10 designated Marina Branch Library and the California Register-eligible Funston bleachers that are identified as contributors to the discontiguous Midcentury Recreation historic district. In addition, the Fort Mason historic district is located to the north of the proposed project. The 3400 Laguna Street property, which is the proposed project site, occupies the western half of a residential block situated
between Laguna and Octavia streets. The following is a brief description of the historic resources near the project site:


* Marina Branch Library ~ Mid-century modern
* Funston Bleachers
* Fort Mason Historic District

The draft omits three significant historic resources that are adjacent to the project site that have much similarity to the Julia Morgan Building—unlike most of the other Art Deco buildings in the Marina District. These are:

* John Reid Jr, 1924

### Front gardens

Structures in San Francisco with extensive front gardens are rare. The Julia Morgan Building has a front garden that is a significant feature of the building


### Comparables

Private premises with a front garden entirely visible to the public extending to the entire length of the block

## 3.B.5 Impacts and Mitigation Measures

page 3.B-28

>Standard 9 – New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

page 3.B-29

>Modifications to the Julia Morgan Building would include some removal of non-historic features that currently detract from the character of the north elevation. The heating and cooling equipment and loading dock that extend from the Julia Morgan Building’s current north elevation would be removed. Other interior and exterior renovations to the Julia Morgan Building would rehabilitate and repair existing features of the historic property and would not
destroy any of the historic materials that characterize the property.

This paragraph covers what the greatest possible aesthetic benefit of the project. The removal of the loading dock and associated accouterments will make the building more attractive and more in keeping with the original design of the building. The view of the project from Bay street will be immeasurably improved
