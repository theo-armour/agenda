# Agenda Journal

## 2025-07-19

So the interesting thing is that it seems that I like to have different journals for different types of agendas.

So that I would have a journal for AI.

A journal for coding and a journal for entities, talking about the specific aspects of each in its own place.

This will help me review ideas specific to that particular agenda.

So if I wanted to talk about health issues and exercise and fitness, but I should go over there and write my thoughts down over in some kind of health or fitness agenda, which I will create now if it's not already there.
