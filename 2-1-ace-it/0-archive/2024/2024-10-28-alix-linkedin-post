Send Me Your Batteries.

I value my energy and time immensely. Every project, client, or company I choose to work with is driven by these fundamental questions:

For next Tuesday ! I like it? what do you think?

🌍 Where can I create the most value—where can my efforts be most impactful, rewarding, and aligned with the well-being of society, the environment, and myself?

❤ Where can I learn most, and who can I learn from?

🔋 What is worth giving my time and energy?

Today, I’ve found value in helping my client NOWOS facilitate the circularity of critical raw materials by repairing batteries. Graphite, Lithium, Cobalt, Copper, Phosphorus, Manganese and Nickel... it's a tangible matter, an industrial activity with visible results and happy customers.

So, send us your batteries for repair :-)

> Send Me Your Batteries.

Is this literal of figurative?

If literal, sending batteries can be expensive, Will you pat me?

If figurative, what do you mean by batteries?? Send energy?

> Where... ~ where... ~ who... ~ what... ~

Good answers could only come from somebody that knows you extremely well. I doubt that many people on LinkedIn know you that well.
