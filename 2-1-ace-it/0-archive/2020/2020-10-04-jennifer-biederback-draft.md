Dear Jennifer

Your Sotheby's bio and LinkedIn profile both indicate a passion for precious gems. May I show you two emeralds?

## Two Emeralds

In 1983 my great aunt Barbara bequeathed me a gold ring with a cabuchon stone that she would call "my tourmaline" (while smiling). Upon receipt of the ring, I brought it over to my mother's local jeweler - a one-man operation in Nassau County NY. The next day, I returned to the jeweler to retrieve the ring and hear his opinion. He shook his head and said "I am not an expert. It's either a piece of plastic or it's the most perfect emerald I have ever seen!" Later I brought the emerald to the Diamond Exchange in New York for an informal appraisal with a well-known expert. When I returned, the appraiser said something like "it's a very nice stone." On the spot, he then offered $40,000 in cash for the ring.

Would you be interested in having a look at this ring?

Unfortunately the 1991 jewelry appraisal is in storage and not easily accessible. This ring and another emerald ring, however, are now in a safe deposit box at a Chase Bank near your office. My daughter Cynthia and I would be happy to bring them over to your office for inspection and advice in valuing and finding new owners.

## Photography, packing, Moving and storage guidance

As you know I am in the process of disengaging myself from my place at The Gateway. I would very much appreciate your wisdom and guidance in pointing me to a person that could help with managing the process of photographing, packing, moving and storing (and restoring if necessary) the works until such time as nice new homes are found for each of the works.

warm regards,

Theo
