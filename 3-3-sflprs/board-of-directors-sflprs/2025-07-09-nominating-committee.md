## 1. What specific skills, experience, or connections can you bring to help advance our mission?

* AEC ~ AEC: Architecture, Engineering and Construction ~ budgets, aesthetics and quality
* Communicating ~ putting my techie skills to good use
* Bon vivant ~ bringing pleasure, beauty, comraderie to the table

## 2. Can you realistically commit to attending board meetings, serving on at least one committee, and dedicating approximately [X hours] per month to board responsibilities?

Yes, my pleasure

## 3. "How do you handle situations where you might disagree with other board members or staff leadership on organizational direction?

* Depends on the priority, don't sweat the small stuff
* Are we talking personal opinions or are the factual or evidence resources we can draw upon?
* Can we find a mediator?
* State my position as clearly as possible and ask to be refuted
* Accept the final decision

## 4. Are you comfortable with the financial oversight responsibilities of board membership, including reviewing budgets, financial statements, and making decisions about organizational spending?

Yes, very aware. And I understand that the Board and myself, as a resident, may have quite divergent views and I will nonetheless accept the consequences.

At the same time, I'm also concerned with gathering and displaying financial information in effective, useful and timely manners.

## 5. Can you describe a time when you've had to make a difficult decision in a leadership role, and how you approached it?

Not really. I've mostly always been an individual contributor. I'm not the one telling other people what to do. I'm the one getting things done. ;-)

Okay, there was one meeting of the Heritage Happenings where several of the committee members were quite critical. And, after a period of reflection, instead of fighting, I decided to try and do exactly what they wanted.

## 6. What draws you to our organization specifically, and how does our mission align with your personal values or interests?

We are no longer in the same position, but I very much resonate with the ideas of the original society of looking after people in destitute situations.

Being an elder, I'm very concerned about elder care. Nonetheless, being a techie and living in this city, I'm also looking at it from the point of view of whether or not there may be startup opportunities.

## 7. What's your understanding of the difference between board governance and day-to-day management, and how would you handle a situation where you disagreed with a staff decision?

I have disagreed with staff decisions on a number of occasions. Being on the Board will give me an opportunity to strike back. ;-)

More to the actual point: There have been aspects or events where staff and residents have had quite problematic issues. I believe it would be good to have a subcommittee to help resolve such disputes. The subcommittee would have some residents, staff, and board members as committee members.

## 8. What does affiliation mean to you?

I think our execs are doing a wonderful job. Nonetheless, I feel that they are highly overworked â€” in the sense that they have to make decisions about very broad areas of expertise.

I look forward to having experts in various fields able to help solve some of the smaller but nonetheless complex problems that occur in dealing with an organization such as ours.

## 9. How will you represent the residents?

It's actually a very interesting question. I don't know yet. I know all the residents and I know many of them very, very well. Some I agree with, and some I have big disagreements with.

I do hope, in some way, to seek out everybody's opinions. Be it by in-person meetings and be it by digital means, this can be done.

## 10. How will you deal with the staff?

I know many of the staff by name, character, and personality, but definitely not all, because there are many staff who residents don't actually encounter.

In one of my former board of directors roles, I was a worker representative on the board. Those aspects still resonate with me to this day. I will seek to be highly conscious of needs and expectations of our team members.

## 11. Where do you see Heritage in the Marina in 10 years time?

We live in an interesting time and place. We all know that San Francisco is a nice place to live. At the same time, we're not always aware that San Francisco is the modern Athens, changing the world as we speak.

For over 150 years, San Francisco has had surplus capital and people willing to invest in crazy new projects, including AI.

I would be delighted to be part of a mission to marry these local and global aspects of our wonderful city right here in our high-tech Julia Morgan Building.

## 12. Any problems?

Yes, of course, it's the revenues. Can I fix these? Of course not. But I can be part of a team that begins to explore new initiatives of interest.

## 13. What have we missed talking about?

OMG! There's wellness and security and maintenance of old buildings, and IT, and activities that suck, and much, much more.
