Dear Ms Calpin & Ms LaValley,

This message relates to the Draft EIR for 3400 Laguna prepared by San Francisco Planning, Case Number 2022-009819ENV and to the Landmark Designation Recommendation, Record number 2024-001869DES.

I have attached two papers as comments relating to the above documents:

The Roses of 3400 Laguna
Comments on Julia Morgan Building: Character-Defining Features

I apologize for the late submission of these comments. I was late coming into the game. I first learned about 3400 LagunaSt-DEIR-Appendices.pdf a couple of weeks ago. I had my first look at 2024-001869DES.pdf yesterday, October 14.

I have been a resident of Heritage on the Marina since 2020. The views and opinions expressed are mine alone and do not represent the views, policy or position of the management of Heritage on the Marina.

If any element in any of my statements could in any way delay or impede the progress of either submission, kindly inform me and I will immediately withdraw these comments.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Yours sincerely,

Theo
