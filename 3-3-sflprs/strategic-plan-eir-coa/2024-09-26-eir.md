Hello Heritage Residents

Today's EIR public hearing for the project has been completed.

There was one public comment by neighbor Tania Alburkerk. She raised the issues of problems the timing of the EIR and Historic Planning Commission investigations not being conducive to fully informed results and the lack of information regarding the Heritage on the Marina financial situation.

Commissioner Kathrin Moore pointed out that the drawings in the report are too small to be read clearly and that the proposed access routes on Bay Street are problematic.

Neither of these views were show stoppers. The EIR moves on to the next stage.

Cheers,

Theo
