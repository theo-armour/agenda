## 3400 Laguna Street Project: Letter in Favor of the Expansion

Date:

My name is Theo Armour.

I live at Heritage on the Marina at 3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco. I have been a resident here for five years.

My three daughters and I have learned that we do not have to worry about my future care. The care I have received at Heritage has been excellent.

Being a resident and neighbor in the Marina has helped me continue to be productive, engaged and useful to society. In order to help assure the future of this high quality,I am in favor of the expansion project.

As a further benefit, the expansion may enable Heritage to continue to serve San Francisco seniors on this site in perpetuity.

In particular I envisage the new larger apartments being a great attraction and benefit to seniors who are downsizing from larger homes. This would free up their properties for younger families in San Francisco.



Furthermore, because its leadership has had the wisdom and perspective to adapt to the changing needs of the community, the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society has served the needs of the people of San Francisco since 1853.

My hope is that the Commission will agree with and approve this latest and pivotal expansion project.



(dba Heritage on the

We hope we can continue to serve San Francisco seniors on this site in
perpetuity.

Thank you for your consideration.

Support for the 3400 Laguna Street Project Expansion

2025-04-14

To whom it may concern,

My name is Theo Armour, and I have been a resident at Heritage on the Marina (3400 Laguna Street, San Francisco) for the past five years.

Living here has provided significant peace of mind for both my three daughters and myself regarding my future care. The quality of care I've received at Heritage has been consistently excellent. Furthermore, being a resident here and part of the Marina neighborhood allows me to remain productive, engaged, and connected to the community.

I believe this expansion is crucial for ensuring that Heritage can continue offering this high standard of care and quality of life for San Francisco seniors long into the future. It represents a vital step in securing the facility's ability to serve residents on this site.

Furthermore, the project offers broader community benefits. The planned larger apartments are likely to attract seniors looking to downsize, potentially freeing up larger homes in the city for families â€“ a positive outcome for San Francisco's housing landscape.

The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society has a long and commendable history of serving the people of San Francisco since 1853, adapting wisely to the changing needs of the community over time. This expansion project represents another necessary adaptation to ensure the Society can continue its mission effectively.

I sincerely hope the Commission will recognize the merits of this pivotal project and grant its approval.

Sincerely,

Theo Armour
Resident, Heritage on the Marina
