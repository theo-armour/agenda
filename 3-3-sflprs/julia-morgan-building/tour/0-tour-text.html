<h1>Tour Text</h1>
<h2>Parlor</h2>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Theo Armour</p>
<p>Welcome to my first scripted organized tour of Heritage on the Marina.</p>
<p>Wifi &amp; contact info</p>
<h3>Program</h3>
<p>Today I will start with a short history.</p>
<p>Then we will go outside to the front and I will show to the magic of the building.</p>
<p>Even if you have walked by this building a thousand times. You will see things you have never seen</p>
<p>Then we will come back in and we will tour other parts of the premises and the gardens</p>
<p>Finally we will come back here, perhaps for a coffee</p>
<p>Bob Connolly Director of Marketing may say a few words on why this is a wonderful place to prow old.</p>
<p>And I will stay on for questions and answers</p>
<p>So let's get going. First me, then the Society then Julia Morgan</p>
<h3>Theo Armour</h3>
<p>Next Village member since last fall</p>
<p>I have been researching and studying the premises ever since I moved here in 2020.</p>
<p>In my younger days I lived for a decade in London while I studied and then practiced architecture.</p>
<p>In london I was involved with over ninety property renovations including a listed building - mostly on brick buildings so I have some background on the topic.</p>
<h3>San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society</h3>
<p>Now, a brief history of the organization that owns this property.</p>
<p>The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society was founded in 1853. It's the second oldest operating charity in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 1853, San Francisco consisted of a small settlement of square whitewashed “portable houses”.</p>
<p>Looking out from the window of one of these makeshift homes on Second Street near Minna Street, was Mrs A B Eaton.</p>
<p>She was startled to see a bareheaded and breathless girl climbing the wooden steps to her house.</p>
<p>Mrs Eaton opened the door and listened while the sobbing stranger poured out her sad story.</p>
<p>The girl had arrived in San Francisco that afternoon - after a four months journey around Cape Horn</p>
<p>She expected to ﬁnd her brother on the dock.</p>
<p>But neither the brother nor any emissary was there.</p>
<p>Maybe he was dead, or off in the mines.</p>
<p>Maybe he had never received the letter she sent.</p>
<p>Asking for help at the dockside, a ship’s acquaintance had directed her to a place nearby.</p>
<p>But the girl took one look at the rouge on the cheeks of the woman who answered the door.</p>
<p>The girl knew immediately that this was no place for a lady.</p>
<p>She had nowhere to stay and no one to turn to for help.</p>
<p>Alone and friendless, she wandered the streets in mounting panic.</p>
<p>The city with all with its gambling dens, saloons and prostitutes was not a safe place for a single woman.</p>
<p>So it was Mrs Eaton’s friendly face in the window that gave the girl the courage to ask for help.</p>
<p>She asked Mrs Eaton to give her protection until they could trace her brother</p>
<p>The girl had come to the right place - a place of kindness.</p>
<p>Thus it was that soon after - on August 4, 1853 Mrs Eaton gathered a group of women from her church and several other churches</p>
<p>The outgrowth of that meeting was the constitution of the San FranciscoLadies Protection and Relief Society.</p>
<p>Its object &quot;to render protection and assistance to strangers, to sick and dependent women and children.”</p>
<p>For the first 75 years of its existence the Society did just that and very successfully.</p>
<p>By the time of the 1906 earthquake, the Society had a large building on the corner of Van Ness and California. By then it was a home for orphans and dependent children.</p>
<p>The building was damaged in the earthquake. over 400 children were evacuated to the Presidio where that were housed in tents for over a year.</p>
<p>But by the 1920 the Federal government had stopped subsidizing the orphanages and concentrated on foster care. It was then the society decided to build a new home concentrate on the needs of the convalescent and elderly women.</p>
<p>They asked Julia Morgan to design the building and she accepted the commission.</p>
<h3>Julia Morgan ~ 1872-1957</h3>
<p>Many of you will know Julia Morgan as the architect of Hearst Castle in San Simeon.</p>
<p>She was the first female architect in California</p>
<p>She was the first women to graduate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris</p>
<p>With over 700 buildings to her credit She was and is the most prolific architect in America.</p>
<p>Frankly we don't know that much about here design intentions, she gave few interviews and left no diaries. Se said &quot;My buildings will speak for themselves.?</p>
<p>Rather than talk about her life, I want to help this building speak to you.</p>
<p>The budget was $150,000; Julia delivered a building that cost $140,000.</p>
<p>Is that why there are no fake columns or coffered ceilings? No wooded paneling or mouldings?</p>
<p>The first thing you may notice is the simplicity of the decorations.</p>
<h3>Reinforced concrete</h3>
<p>You don't see any fake columns or coffered ceilings. There's no wooded paneling or mouldings. How come? Most building in the twenties were decorated with these things. But not this building. Why not?</p>
<p>As you probably noticed when you came in this is a brick building. People love thr warmth of brick buildings. But not in earthquake country.</p>
<p>But Julia was famous for building earthquake resistant buildings.</p>
<p>She was one of the first to use reinforced concrete in California.</p>
<p>And she used it here. The structure is evident in the building.</p>
<p>The structure is speaking to you &quot;This building is earthquake resistant&quot;.</p>
<h3>Roses</h3>
<p>Now cast your eyes to the fireplace. You see four floral patterns in four squares. As we will see these flowers are roses.</p>
<p>And the two gold metal ties to either side are rosebuds. Unfortunately they originals were stripped away along with ties for all the windows here in the parlor.</p>
<p>Why the roses? It's a question I keep asking. In that era the decorations were often symbols of the intents and purposes of the building.</p>
<p>So let us now start to look at the building. What symbols can we find? How can they speak to us and what are they saying?</p>
<p>Let us start the investigation. So let us now go back outside of the building. I suggest we start near the left side gate at the front of the building.</p>
<h2>Front of house</h2>
<h3>Three Roses</h3>
<p>Above the bay window seconfd floor you see two double windows.</p>
<p>In between the windows there is a panel. Terracotta a baked clay with decorations.</p>
<p>What are those decorations?</p>
<p>What is the style of the building? Elizabethan? Jacobean? We usually call it &quot;Tudor Revival&quot;. House of Lancaster and House of York. both used the rose as their symbol. one red one white.  later both combined into the Tudor Rose.</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>

<p>Buildings can speak to you if you listen.</p>
<p>Even brutalist buildings can speak to you.</p>

<li>Similar: Moscone Recreation Center ~ PGE ~ Stable: all brick</li>

<li>Much is conjecture</li>
<li>Work-in-progress</li>
<li>I am researching ~ drawings on the way</li>
<li>I am still using the knowledge that took decades to acquire</li>
<li>I am still adding to the knowledge</li>
<li>Open to suggestions. to your observations and to your questions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Closing</h3>
<p>If you agree with me that you have been in a building with roses everywhere and that the rose is a symbol of love and caring.</p>
<p>And if you agree that the rose is an outward and visible symbol of an inward and spiritual grace.</p>
<p>Then you must agree with me that this Julia Morgan Building is the loveliest building in San Francisco.</p>
