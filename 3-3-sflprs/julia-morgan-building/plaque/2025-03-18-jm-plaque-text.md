## Body Text

Commissioned by the San Francisco Ladies
Protection and Relief Society and opened in 1925, 
this Jacobean Revival building was designed by
AIA Gold Medal architect Julia Morgan.

A brick, terracotta, and slate exterior, adorned 
with Tudor rosesâ€”symbols of love, encases an 
earthquake-resilient, reinforced-concrete structure.

Today, as Heritage on the Marina, the premises serve
as a retirement community. Its expansive gardens and
timeless design embody an historic legacy of charity
and architectural significance, offering a serene
and graceful setting for residents and team members.
