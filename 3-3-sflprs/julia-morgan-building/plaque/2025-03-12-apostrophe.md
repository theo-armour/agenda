Hi Patti

The use of the apostrophe in the title San Francisco Ladies' Protection and Relief Society is highly impactful â€” and meaningful to me.

The apostrophe is used to indicate possession. 

If an apostrophe is placed after the word ladies, it indicates the society belongs to the ladies.

If the apostrophe is omitted, it indicate that the society is protecting and relieving ladies.

Now that the minutes of the society's minutes are being scanned, it will be interesting to see how the society's name is used in the minutes over the years.

My personal concern is quite different.

With the apostrophe it's read like a group of high-falutin' ladies looking after destitute women. 

Without the apostrophe, it's a group of ladies looking after other ladies.

Perhaps I am sensitive. I grew up in a particularly high falutin' environment. And this little detail is a reminder of the snobbery and classism that could occur in tiny word choices. I prefer the idea of equals looking after equals.

In my writing I always omit the apostrophe. I accept that any person editing my text may add it back in. And that's OK. I just like to make my preference clear.
