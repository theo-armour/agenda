Hi Josh

Thank you for our conversation today. I am following up with the images for the Julia Morgan Building plaque replicas

Here are the attached files:

* CLIENT.COPY.ART.as.JPG.file_v4_03 19 25.jpg
* CLIENT.COPY.ART.as.vectored.AI.v10.file_v4_03 19 25.ai
* Dryfast-seal-of-city-and-county-of-san-francisco.jpg

Unfortunately, when I open the AI file using Inkscape, I just get two plank pages, but your mileage may be different

Also the SF Seal file is separate and needs to be pasted onto the plaque image.

I guess my question is, can you work with JPG files? And what resolution or quality do you need? And I get updates from SoCal Bronze.

Anyway, please call me to let me know what you actually need in order to proceed

Cheers,

Theo
