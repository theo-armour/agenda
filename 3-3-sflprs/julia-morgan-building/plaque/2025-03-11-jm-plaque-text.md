## Request for Quote: San Francisco Landmark Plaque

This is a request for a quote for a new San Francisco landmark designation plaque. The plaque will be placed on the facade of the building.

Typical sizes and materials are unknown to me, perhaps you can help.

I would appreciate a ball park figure and estimated delivery time. 

The details are as follows:

## Body Text

Commissioned by the San Francisco Ladies
Protection and Relief Society and opened in 1925, 
this Jacobean Revival building was designed by
AIA Gold Medal architect Julia Morgan.

A brick, terracotta, and slate exterior, adorned 
with Tudor rosesâ€”symbols of love, encases an 
earthquake-resilient reinforced-concrete structure.

Today, as Heritage on the Marina, the premises serve
as a retirement community. Its expansive gardens and
timeless design embodies an historic legacy of charity
and architectural significance, offering a serene
and graceful setting for residents and team members.
