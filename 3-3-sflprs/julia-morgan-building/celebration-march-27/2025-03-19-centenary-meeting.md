# 2025-03-19 Centenary Meeting

## Landmark Plaque

The plaque is a work-in progress. I found three errors in vendors transcription of my text. Can you find more?


These wil be corrected. In principe the text is approved by Mary and Pilar LaValley, the SF Planner

The plaque will not be delivered by March 27. I plan to have a life size image of the plaque on display on an easel at the celebration.

I am also investigating the possibility of having some kind of replica of the plaque for Mary to present to the Mayor, Supervisor and Randy in order to generate a photo op for the Mayor's Instagram (and ours).

## Slide Show

I am preparing a slide show of images of the building. These are only to remind guests that the event is about a work of art. They will not be a focus of the event, just reminder. In order not to be a distraction or for projector light to shine in people's eyes, the slides will be projected on to the ceiling. I gave a demonstration of this on Monday. Mary, Patti and Hector all used to the same word,"Cool."

## Hand Out

A PDF of the reprint I prepared of the article from SF Heritage Newsletter is attached.


## Speeches

I met with Carolyn Kiernat of Page and Turnbull. We are coordinating our talks

## Invites

Patti has invited Pilar LaValley, who is the San Francisco Planner who expedited the landmark designation.

If desired, I could invite one or two people of relevance

## Future Events

SF Heritage would be please to hold an architectural tour of the building and along with a reception sometime after June.
