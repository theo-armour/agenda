Hi Mary

Here is a link to a clip of the Board of Supervisors meeting video.

I would like to create a PDF to share that contains

* A link to the video with QR code
* The photos that were taken
* Transcripts of the speeches
* A scan of the resolution

Can you get the Front Office to scan it or should I take a photo of it?

It would be great to show the video at the next Leadership Update.
