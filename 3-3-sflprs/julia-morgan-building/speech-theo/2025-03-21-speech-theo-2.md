"I guess you could say Julia Morgan was the original 'house whisperer' – she heard what buildings wanted to say."

Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Sherrill, Members of the Board of Directors, distinguished residents and team members, and fellow citizens,

You have likely passed by this building countless times. You may have even entered it. But have you ever truly looked at it?

My goal here is to reveal to you the secrets of the Julia Morgan Building.

It's a story with a rich history.

Two years ago, we celebrated in this parlor the 170th anniversary of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society - the second oldest charitable organization in the city.

Today, we gather to honor the 100th anniversary of the Julia Morgan Building, the Society's enduring gift to the city.

Not surprisingly, the Society has a history of employing the most illustrious architects of their day. In 1923, they commissioned Julia Morgan to design a building that would serve as a home for the elderly and infirm.

Julia Morgan, designer of San Simeón, the Hearst Castle, and the Fairmont Hotel, responsible for over 750 projects, remains the most prolific architect in American history.

Even so, I want to suggest - the secret I want to share - that the Julia Morgan Building is one of her most beautiful efforts.

This is not as straightforward as it sounds. Although we know a fair amount about her personal life, she was reticent about her work. She left no memoirs, no diaries. She gave few interviews. As she said: "My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone."

The question at hand is: What is this building telling us? What secrets is it whispering as we walk by?

It's a building that resembles those built in England during the time of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth.

It's constructed with brick, terracotta, and slate.

And like quality buildings of that era, it has what we moderns would call decorations.

In the past, these decorations had meanings. They stood for something. They were symbols. They spoke to you.

The cross represents Christianity, the Star of David represents Judaism, the crescent represents Islam.

Well, what about this building? The landmark designation documents admire the "floral decorations" on the building.

But what if Julia is trying to communicate with us? What if she's trying to tell us something through these decorations?

Let's take a closer look.

Over the past five years, I've walked around this building many times.

Just above the outside front door, there are two shields. Unadorned. Just shields.

Why do you carry a shield? To protect yourself, of course. What is the name of the organization that built this building? The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.

The largest decoration is the two large terracotta panels on the second floor above the two bay windows on each side. Each one contains three images of a flower. What flower?

This is a Tudor Revival building. The Tudors were the English royal family from 1485 to 1603.

The Tudor rose is the traditional floral heraldic emblem of England and takes its name and origins from the Tudor dynasty.

The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster.

There was a war between the two houses. The War of the Roses. The Tudor rose symbolized the end of the war. The union of the two houses.

These are definitely similar to Tudor roses. Except they have four sides instead of the traditional five. But they are definitely roses.

Looking around the building, you can see these roses in at least twenty different places. Even indoors. There are four on the fireplace in the parlor. And four more on the altar in the chapel.

So why did Julia focus so much on the rose?

The rose is an ancient symbol of love.

Valentine's cards / Burns "My love is like a red, red rose"

You are in a building surrounded by symbols of love.

Julia was designing a building for destitute and incapacitated women. She wanted you to feel safe and comforted.

The panels with three roses? Three roses stand for the words "I love you."

Guess what? It works.

Go up to the art gallery on the second floor. There's an exhibit on the history of the building's life and the art of its residents. It's a love letter to the building. From a community filled with love.

Julia is still speaking to us.

Let us return the compliment. Please raise your glasses.

To Julia Morgan! We love you!

or

Cheers to Julia!
