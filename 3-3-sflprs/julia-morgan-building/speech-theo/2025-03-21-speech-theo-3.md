Mayor Lurie, Supervisor Sherrill, Members of the Board of Directors, distinguished residents and team members, and fellow citizens,

You've likely passed by this building countless times. You may have even entered it. But have you ever truly looked at it?

My goal here is to reveal to you the secrets of the Julia Morgan Building.

It's a story with a rich history. Two years ago, we celebrated in this parlor the 170th anniversary of the San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society - the second oldest charitable organization in the city.

Today, we gather to honor the 100th anniversary of the Julia Morgan Building, the Society's enduring gift to the city.

Not surprisingly, the Society has a history of employing the most illustrious architects of their day. In 1923, they commissioned Julia Morgan to design a building that would serve as a home for the elderly and infirm.

Julia Morgan, designer of San Sime√≥n, the Hearst Castle, and the Fairmont Hotel, remains the most prolific architect in American history. As she said: "My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone."

This building is a Tudor Revival masterpiece, constructed with brick, terracotta, and slate. The decorations here are more than just aesthetic; they carry meaning. In the past, such decorations were symbols that spoke to people.

The landmark designation documents admire the "floral decorations" on the building. But what if Julia is trying to communicate with us through these decorations?

Let's take a closer look. Just above the outside front door, there are two shields. Unadorned. Just shields. Why do you carry a shield? To protect yourself, of course. What is the name of the organization that built this building? The San Francisco Ladies Protection and Relief Society.

The largest decoration is the two large terracotta panels on the second floor. Each contains three images of a flower - the Tudor rose. This rose symbolized the end of the War of the Roses, uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster.

Looking around, you can see these roses in at least twenty different places. Even indoors. There are four on the fireplace in the parlor and four more on the altar in the chapel.

So why did Julia focus so much on the rose? The rose is an ancient symbol of love. Julia was designing a building for destitute and incapacitated women. She wanted you to feel safe and comforted.

The panels with three roses? Three roses stand for the words "I love you." Guess what? It works. Go up to the art gallery on the second floor. There's an exhibit on the history of the building's life and the art of its residents. It's a love letter to the building. From a community filled with love.

Julia is still speaking to us. Let us return the compliment. Please raise your glasses.

To Julia Morgan! We love you!
