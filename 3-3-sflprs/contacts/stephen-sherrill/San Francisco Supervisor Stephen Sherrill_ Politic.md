## San Francisco Supervisor Stephen Sherrill: Political Priorities

### Public Safety and Clean Streets

- **Primary priority:** Sherrill consistently cites *public safety* and the creation of *safe, clean streets* as his top focus. He emphasizes restoring confidence in city safety, supporting full staffing of the police department, and providing officers with better tools—like license plate readers and speed cameras—to address crime and improve response times[^1][^2][^3].
- Strong advocate for programs such as *Urban Alchemy* and ambassador initiatives to enhance neighborhood safety and cleanliness[^1][^4].


### Addressing Homelessness and Recovery

- Led creation of *ASTRID*—a system integrating housing, health, and emergency response data to support unhoused residents[^5][^1][^6].
- Supports a *housing-first* model but insists it must be complemented by substance use treatment and job assistance.
- Champions *recovery and reintegration* for those impacted by addiction, with an emphasis on access to treatment and workforce reintegration[^1][^7].


### Affordability and Family Life

- Advocates for gradual, evidence-driven reform to make San Francisco more affordable for families and businesses.
- Targets removal of outdated, burdensome regulations that increase local costs, and supports incentive programs such as “First Year Free” to encourage small business growth and vibrancy in commercial corridors[^1][^6][^7].
- Prioritizes policies that help families start and remain in San Francisco throughout all stages of life[^5][^8].


### Small Business and Economic Recovery

- Seeks to simplify the business environment by reducing red tape and reforming the city’s tax and permitting structure[^7][^4].
- Emphasizes the need to retain essential businesses and revitalize downtown, advocating for sustainable support measures for local merchants and job creators[^6][^7][^9].
- Works on legislative efforts focused on tackling high commercial vacancy rates, especially along key corridors like Van Ness[^8].


### Housing and Permitting Reform

- Dedicated to accelerating stalled housing projects by streamlining permitting and city processes, believing that “buildable” proposals must be able to move forward without unnecessary obstacles[^6][^4].
- Advocates for expanding housing options and enhancing walkability and transit as a long-term means to improve overall affordability and livability.


### Budget Responsibility

- Frames closing the city’s budget deficit as a multi-year project requiring measured evaluation rather than selective or politically-motivated cuts.
- Focuses on preserving funding for emergency services and economic recovery during tight budget cycles, emphasizing fiscal responsibility[^1][^4].


### Constituent Engagement and Transparency

- Values accessibility and responsiveness to residents, frequently meeting community members and prioritizing direct constituent services as a core office value[^5][^8].
- Stresses accountability and data-driven decision-making throughout city operations, aiming to strengthen trust between city government and the publi[^5][^6].

Stephen Sherrill’s politics center on improving public safety and street cleanliness, addressing homelessness, making San Francisco more affordable for working families and businesses, supporting small business recovery, reforming permitting and housing processes, exercising fiscal responsibility, and ensuring robust engagement with constituents[^5][^1][^6].
