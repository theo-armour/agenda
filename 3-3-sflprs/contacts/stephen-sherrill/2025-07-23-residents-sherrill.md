# 2025-07-23 Today: 3pm: Supervisor Sherrill: Friendship Hall

Hello Residents and friends

This Afternoon at 3 pm in Friendship Hall, our San Francisco District Supervisor, Stephen Sherrill, will be our speaker.

Please think of some good questions you can ask!

Here are Supervisor Sherrill's priorities:

## Primary Priority: Public Safety and Clean Streets

* Sherrill consistently cites public safety and the creation of safe, clean streets as his top focus. He emphasizes restoring confidence in city safety, supporting full staffing of the police department, and providing officers with better tools.

## Addressing Homelessness and Recovery

* Supports a housing-first model but insists it must be complemented by substance use treatment and job assistance

## Affordability and Family Life

* Targets removal of outdated, burdensome regulations that increase local costs, and supports incentive programs to encourage small business growth and vibrancy in commercial corridors
* Prioritizes policies that help families start and remain in San Francisco throughout all stages of life
