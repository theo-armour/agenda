# Welcome, Supervisor Sherrill.

Supervisor Sherrill was appointed to represent our district by Mayor London Breed in 2024,

filling the seat vacated by our friend Catherine Stefani

after her election to the California State Assembly.

Though just a few months into his tenure, he's already engaged with our community

—joining us at Heritage on the Marina in March for the Julia Morgan Building Centenary Celebration.

But we didn't give him much time to speak then, so we have questions that need answering.

That's why we invited him back. And here he is.

Supervisor Sherrill, let me start with three questions:

Your term ends in January 2027. **Will you seek election?**

My research tells me your priorities include public safety, clean streets, homelessness, affordability, and family life.
 **Have you seen progress on these fronts?**

San Francisco Mayor Dan Lurie's popularity recently hit an astronomical 73% — even making national news.

**Can you achieve similar success?**

That was the lighthearted portion of our afternoon.

The reality, of course, stands in stark contrast:

* budget deficits
* unaffordable housing,
* bureaucratic gridlock
* and much more.

With that, I give you the floor.

Please welcome Supervisor Stephen Sherrill.
