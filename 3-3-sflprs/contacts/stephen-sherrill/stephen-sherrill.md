## 2025-06-16 ~ Invitation to Speak at Heritage on the Marina

Hi Lorenzo

Thank you for attending the Sacramento seminar lunch last Friday. I continue to be impressed with Supervisor Sherrill's capabilities and knowledge of the difficulties of this city. I'm also very glad that you came along to back him up so as to be knowledgeable about his duties and obligations. You provide the opportunity for his constituents to reach out to him without interfering with his many duties.

So here I am reaching out. ;-)

Over the weekend, in several discussions with residents here where I live at Heritage on the Marina, I was pleased to hear that residents would be very pleased to have the Supervisor come and talk to us about his future agenda for the District.

I imagine we could have between 40 and 60 residents and perhaps more if we invited residents in the neighborhood.

If you feel am appearance might be possible, I would be very pleased to discuss date and time and other details.

Cheers,

Theo

Hi Lorenzo,
Thank you for attending the Sacramento seminar lunch last Friday. I continue to be impressed with Supervisor Sherrill's capabilities and knowledge of the city's challenges. I appreciate your support role in helping constituents connect with him.
Over the weekend, I spoke with several Heritage on the Marina residents who expressed strong interest in having the Supervisor discuss his future agenda for the District. We could expect 40-60 residents, potentially more if we include the broader neighborhood.
If an appearance might be possible, I'd be happy to discuss scheduling and details.
