# Welcome Supervisor Sherrill

Supervisor Sherrill was appointed to represent our District by Mayor London Breed in 2024. He filled the post after it was vacated by our friend Catherine Stefani following her election to the California State Assembly.

He is just a few months into his post.

Nonetheless, he was already here at Heritage on the Marina in March at the Julia Morgan Building Centenary Celebration.

But we did not give him much time to tell us about what's going on, So we have a lot of questions that need answering.

And so we invited him back, and he here he is

Supervisor Sherrill: Here are three questions that might be fun to have answers for.

Your term ends in January 2027.

* Will you seek election?

My AI program tells me that your priorities include Public Safety, Clean Streets, Homelessness, Affordability and Family Life

* Has you seen any progress?

San Francisco Mayer Dan Lurie's popularity rating recently hit the astronomical figure of 73% - even making national news.

* Will you be able to do the same?

Well, that was a bit of a lighthearted intro

It stands in deep contrast to the current situation of this city

* which is budget deficits
* people without housing they can afford
* bureaucratic obfuscation and much more.

With that I give you the floor.

Please welcome Supervisor Stephen Sherrill.
