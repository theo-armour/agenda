RayBan glasses for the first time in a while. I think what I might do is leave them on my desk and just be able to switch my glasses from my regular glasses to the rayban glasses so I can just pick up and start talking. Quietly, without having to close my door and being able to listen on the phone and be able, as I said, be to be quiet.

It's raining and howling out there. Lovely to be inside and loved it to be able to look at the weather outside and be cozy here.

I was hoping to wear them outside on my walks comma, but the whole thing of taking off my glasses, regular glasses and finding a place for them, opening up the glasses holder for the ray ban and then getting those out and putting those on and then finding a place for the glasses case is just too complicated. Period. But maybe just sitting on my desk I can just take one pair on and one pair off. Just leaving the other pair on the desk.

Ray ban glasses are not just closed source, but they're closed environment, so there's no way I can do something like add audio pen or my own voice to text app to work with the glasses. I will look forward to products that can do this
