Thank goodness, I found a post on using the glasses with windows. Period. The trick is to. Set the two monitors, one above the other, and not side by side. I am doing this now. The glasses Monitor  is above the laptop Monitor. I can see both screens quite easily.

I have a vs code. Above It is extremely clear, and I can read the text Easily. The browser is below and by raising my head and looking down, I can see it very clearly.
