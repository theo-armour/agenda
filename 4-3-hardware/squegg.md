### Script

Hello, this is Theo Armour talking to you from San Francisco
It's September XX 2023.
Today, I talk about the Squegg hand device.
Squegg ~ the egg-shaped device to help you maintain your grip.
I've been using the Squegg for a few months now.
I use the Squegg as part of a daily fitness routine
I am a 76-year old partial paraplegic with a left hand amputation.

#### Closing

Now I have completed my Squegg routine.
my hand grip is has been well-exercised.
I hope you have been able to gain some new insights on the usage of the Squegg.
Thank you for watching.
