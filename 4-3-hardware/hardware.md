### To Install

[] AutoHotKey or other < PhraseExpress
[] VS Code
[] GitHub for Windows
[x] Evernote
[] Update drivers

## BIOS

* On start press Power and Volume +


### Questions

* Home and End button polyfills? Not??


### Theo Dashboard on Win10

* Can edit Google Doc
* Plays Pandora radio in tab
* Plays Fidgetty sounds

2016-12-29 ~ TheYoga looking like the better dashboard at home solution today


### Coding

* Codeanywhere seems the way to go
	* If Dropbox is up to date
	* Best way to send Codeanywhere files to GitHub?


### Pros

* Speed not an issue - Runs Three.js at acceptable speeds

### Cons

* Needs very flat surface - otherwise it jiggles
* Screen is quite small
	* Makes you hunch down to look at it
	* Think about wireless/Miracast? monitor < or smartmouse?
	* Need to work out Windows and Chrome zoom scales
	* 2016-12-06: tablet mode helps
* Switching between keyboard, touching the sceen, using the touchpad and using the 'Create Pad'
	* Could also have a mouse! ;-)
	* Can get confusing

## Pixel C

* Move off this device?
* The best device for voice recognition
* Keyboard better than Yoga Book

## Theo Dashboard on Android

* Can't use Pandora anymore - wants an app
* No sounds with Fidgetty
* Can't edit Google Doc inside an iframe - must open in own tab
	* Also more difficult to open file maybe

* Looks like better on-the-go out=and-about solution

## Codeanywhere

* Using the CA app
	* Typing gets messed up when using inside Chrome browser
* Not sure about best way of saving and auto-save
	* Asterisk appears in tab after a change is made

## Hints

* Virtual Keyboard >> turn off >> click keyboad icon in lower right corner next to apps icon
