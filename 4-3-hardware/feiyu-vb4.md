## Remarks

* Takes too long to Attach the camera to the stand. And too much time to adjust
* Needs Magsafe type attachment possibility
* Using Joystick, the movements are too drastic for good control at high zoom levels.
* After you Use the joystick, the camera keeps on moving for a few seconds and takes quite a while to land in its final spot

## Using the FeiYu App

* Cannot use voice. To take photos Or otherwise control the camera
* Cannot use the app to adjust scroll speed and other settings
* Operation is just too clunky and slow

## Possible uses.

The gimbal is just good for walking around with a camera and having a nice, smooth motion in the video
* Much better to use the Samsung camera app rather than the Fei app.
